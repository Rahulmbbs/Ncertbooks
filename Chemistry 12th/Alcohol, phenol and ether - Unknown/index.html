  <p class="calibre7"><em class="red">Alcohols, phenols and ethers are the basic compounds for the formation of detergents, antiseptics and fragrances, respectively.</em></p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre7">You have learnt that substitution of one or more hydrogen atom(s) from a hydrocarbon by another atom or a group of atoms result in the formation of an entirely new compound having altogether different properties and applications. Alcohols and phenols are formed when a hydrogen atom in a hydrocarbon, aliphatic and aromatic respectively, is replaced by &ndash;OH group. These classes of compounds find wide applications in industry as well as in day-to-day life. For instance, have you ever noticed that ordinary spirit used for polishing wooden furniture is chiefly a compound containing hydroxyl group, ethanol. The sugar we eat, the cotton used for fabrics, the paper we use for writing, are all made up of compounds containing &ndash;OH groups. Just think of life without paper; no note-books, books, newspapers, currency notes, cheques, certificates, etc. The magazines carrying beautiful photographs and interesting stories would disappear from our life. It would have been really a different world.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">An alcohol contains one or more hydroxyl (OH) group(s) directly attached to carbon atom(s), of an aliphatic system (CH<sub class="calibre12">3</sub>OH) while a phenol contains &ndash;OH group(s) directly attached to carbon atom(s) of an aromatic system (C<sub class="calibre12">6</sub>H<sub class="calibre12">5</sub>OH).</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The subsitution of a hydrogen atom in a hydrocarbon by an alkoxy or aryloxy group (R&ndash;O/Ar&ndash;O) yields another class of compounds known as 'ethers', for example, CH<sub class="calibre12">3</sub>OCH<sub class="calibre12">3</sub> (dimethyl ether). You may also visualise ethers as compounds formed by substituting the hydrogen atom of hydroxyl group of an alcohol or phenol by an alkyl or aryl group.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">In this unit, we shall discuss the chemistry of three classes of compounds, namely &mdash; alcohols, phenols and ethers.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The classification of compounds makes their study systematic and hence simpler. Therefore, let us first learn how are alcohols, phenols and ethers classified?</p>

  <h5 class="calibre27"><strong class="calibre14">11.2 Nomenclature</strong></h5>

  <p class="calibre22">(a) Alcohols: The common name of an alcohol is derived from the common name of the alkyl group and adding the word alcohol to it. For example, CH<sub class="calibre12">3</sub>OH is methyl alcohol. According to IUPAC system (Unit 12, Class XI), the name of an alcohol is derived from the name of the alkane from which the alcohol is derived, by substituting 'e' of alkane with the suffix 'ol'. The position of substituents are indicated by numerals. For this, the longest carbon chain (parent chain) is numbered starting at the end nearest to the hydroxyl group. The positions of the &ndash;OH group and other substituents are indicated by using the numbers of carbon atoms to which these are attached. For naming polyhydric alcohols, the 'e' of alkane is retained and the ending 'ol' is added. The number of &ndash;OH groups is indicated by adding the multiplicative prefix, di, tri, etc., before 'ol'. The positions of &ndash;OH groups are indicated by appropriate locants e.g., HO&ndash;CH<sub class="calibre12">2</sub>&ndash;CH<sub class="calibre12">2</sub>&ndash;OH is named as ethane&ndash;1, 2-diol. Table 11.1 gives common and IUPAC names of a few alcohols as examples.</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre16">Table 11.1: Common and IUPAC Names of Some Alcohols</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre4"></p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="56" src="images/000054.png" class="calibre17" /><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre7">Cyclic alcohols are named using the prefix cyclo and considering the &mdash;OH group attached to C&ndash;1.</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="8" src="images/000058.JPG" class="calibre17" /><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre22">(b) Phenols: The simplest hydroxy derivative of benzene is phenol. It is its common name and also an accepted IUPAC name. As structure of phenol involves a benzene ring, in its substituted compounds the terms ortho (1,2- disubstituted), meta (1,3-disubstituted) and para (1,4-disubstituted) are often used in the common names.</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre16">Common name IUPAC name</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="images/000089.JPG" class="calibre28" /></p>

  <p class="calibre7">Dihydroxy derivatives of benzene are known as 1, 2-, 1, 3- and 1, 4-benzenediol.</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre16">Common name IUPAC name</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="10" src="images/000070.JPG" class="calibre17" /><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre22">(c) Ethers: Common names of ethers are derived from the names of alkyl/ aryl groups written as separate words in alphabetical order and adding the word 'ether' at the end. For example, CH<sub class="calibre12">3</sub>OC<sub class="calibre12">2</sub>H<sub class="calibre12">5</sub> is ethylmethyl ether.</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre16">Table 11.2: Common and IUPAC Names of Some Ethers</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre4"></p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="57" src="images/000063.png" class="calibre17" /><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre22">If both the alkyl groups are the same, the prefix 'di' is added before the alkyl group. For example, C<sub class="calibre12">2</sub>H<sub class="calibre12">5</sub>OC<sub class="calibre12">2</sub>H<sub class="calibre12">5</sub> is diethyl ether.</p>

  <p class="calibre22">In alcohols, the oxygen of the &ndash;OH group is attached to carbon by a sigma (s ) bond formed by the overlap of a sp<sup class="calibre23">3</sup> hybridised orbital of carbon with a sp<sup class="calibre23">3</sup> hybridised orbital of oxygen.

The carbon&ndash; oxygen bond length (136 pm) in phenol is slightly less than that in methanol. This is due to (i) partial double bond character on account of the conjugation of unshared electron pair of oxygen with the aromatic ring (Section 11.4.4) and</p>

The C&ndash;O bond length (141 pm) is almost the same as in alcohols.</span>

  <p class="calibre7">Alcohols are prepared by the following methods:</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre16">1. From alkenes</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre22">(i) By acid catalysed hydration: Alkenes react with water in the presence of acid as catalyst to form alcohols. In case of unsymmetrical alkenes, the addition reaction takes place in accordance with Markovnikov's rule (Unit 13, Class XI).</p>

  <p class="calibre22"></p>

  <p class="calibre22">(ii) By hydroboration&ndash;oxidation: Diborane (BH<sub class="calibre12">3</sub>)<sub class="calibre12">2</sub> reacts with alkenes to give trialkyl boranes as addition product. This is oxidised to alcohol by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of aqueous sodium hydroxide.</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="images/000028.JPG" class="calibre31" /></p>

  <p class="calibre22">The addition of borane to the double bond takes place in such a manner that the boron atom gets attached to the sp<sup class="calibre23">2</sup> carbon carrying greater number of hydrogen atoms. The alcohol so formed looks as if it has been formed by the addition of water to the alkene in a way opposite to the Markovnikov's rule. In this reaction,alcohol is obtained in excellent yield.</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="65" src="images/000077.png" class="calibre17" /><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre7">The above reactions show that alcohols and phenols are acidic in nature. In fact, alcohols and phenols are Brönsted acids i.e., they can donate a proton to a stronger base (B:).</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="66" src="images/000096.png" class="calibre17" /><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre7">(ii) <em class="calibre9">Acidity of alcohols</em>: The acidic character of alcohols is due to the polar nature of O&ndash;H bond. An electron-releasing group (&ndash;CH<sub class="calibre12">3</sub>, &ndash;C<sub class="calibre12">2</sub>H<sub class="calibre12">5</sub>) increases electron density on oxygen tending to decrease the polarity of O-H bond. This decreases the acid strength. For this reason, the acid strength of alcohols decreases in the following order:</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="images/000024.JPG" class="calibre39" /></p>

  <p class="calibre7">Alcohols are, however, weaker acids than water. This can be illustrated by the reaction of water with an alkoxide.</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="images/000035.JPG" class="calibre40" /></p>

  <p class="calibre22">This reaction shows that water is a better proton donor (i.e., stronger acid) than alcohol. Also, in the above reaction, we note that an alkoxide ion is a better proton acceptor than hydroxide ion, which suggests that alkoxides are stronger bases (sodium ethoxide is a stronger base than sodium hydroxide).</p>

  <p class="calibre7">Alcohols act as Bronsted bases as well. It is due to the presence of unshared electron pairs on oxygen, which makes them proton acceptors.</p>

  <div class="calibre18">
    <span class="calibre19">(iii) Acidity of phenols:</span> <span class="calibre19">The reactions of phenol with metals (e.g., sodium, aluminium) and sodium hydroxide indicate its acidic nature. The hydroxyl group, in phenol is directly attached to the sp<sup class="calibre23">2</sup> hybridised carbon of benzene ring which acts as an electron withdrawing group. Due to this, the charge distribution in phenol molecule, as depicted in its resonance structures, causes the oxygen of &ndash;OH group to be positive.</span>
  </div>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="67" src="images/000104.png" class="calibre17" /><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre7">The reaction of phenol with aqueous sodium hydroxide indicates that phenols are stronger acids than alcohols and water. Let us examine how a compound in which hydroxyl group attached to an aromatic ring is more acidic than the one in which hydroxyl group is attached to an alkyl group. The ionisation of an alcohol and a phenol takes place as follows:</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="43" src="images/000042.JPG" class="calibre17" /><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre22"></p>

  <p class="calibre22">Due to the higher electronegativity of sp<sup class="calibre23">2</sup> hybridised carbon of phenol to which &ndash;OH is attached, electron density decreases on oxygen. This increases the polarity of O&ndash;H bond and results in an increase in ionisation of phenols than that of alcohols. Now let us examine the stabilities of alkoxide and phenoxide ions. In alkoxide ion, the negative charge is localised on oxygen while in phenoxide ion, the charge is delocalised. The delocalisation of negative charge (structures I-V) makes phenoxide ion more stable and favours the ionisation of phenol. Although there is also charge delocalisation in phenol, its resonance structures have charge separation due to which the phenol molecule is less stable than phenoxide ion.</p>

  <p class="calibre22"></p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="images/000053.JPG" class="calibre41" /></p>

  <p class="calibre22">In substituted phenols, the presence of electron withdrawing groups such as nitro group, enhances the acidic strength of phenol. This effect is more pronounced when such a group is present at ortho and para positions. It is due to the effective delocalisation of negative charge in phenoxide ion. On the other hand, electron releasing groups, such as alkyl groups, in general, do not favour the formation of phenoxide ion resulting in decrease in acid strength. Cresols, for example, are less acidic than phenol.</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="72" src="images/000082.png" class="calibre17" /><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre7">The acid used in step 1 is released in step 3. To drive the equilibrium to the right, ethene is removed as it is formed.</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
  4. Oxidation: Oxidation of alcohols involves the formation of a carbonoxygen double bond with cleavage of an O-H and C-H bonds.</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="images/000056.JPG" class="calibre46" /></p>

  <p class="calibre7">Such a cleavage and formation of bonds occur in oxidation reactions. These are also known as dehydrogenation reactions as these involve loss of dihydrogen from an alcohol molecule. Depending on the oxidising agent used, a primary alcohol is oxidised to an aldehyde which in turn is oxidised to a carboxylic acid.</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="images/000067.JPG" class="calibre42" /></p>

  <p class="calibre7">Strong oxidising agents such as acidified potassium permanganate are used for getting carboxylic acids from alcohols directly. CrO<sub class="calibre12">3</sub> in anhydrous medium is used as the oxidising agent for the isolation of aldehydes.</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="images/000080.JPG" class="calibre47" /></p>

  <p class="calibre7">A better reagent for oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes in good yield is pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), a complex of chromium trioxide with pyridine and HCl.</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="60" src="images/000061.JPG" class="calibre17" /><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre7">Tertiary alcohols do not undergo oxidation reaction.

  <p class="calibre7">The usual halogenation of benzene takes place in the presence of a Lewis acid, such as FeBr<sub class="calibre12">3</sub> (Unit 10, Class XII), which polarises the halogen molecule.

  <p class="calibre22">In wine making, grapes are the source of sugars and yeast. As grapes ripen, the quantity of sugar increases and yeast grows on the outer skin. When grapes are crushed, sugar and the enzyme come in contact and fermentation starts. Fermentation takes place in anaerobic conditions i.e. in absence of air. Carbon dioxide is released during fermentation.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The action of zymase is inhibited once the percentage of alcohol formed exceeds 14 percent. If air gets into fermentation mixture, the oxygen of air oxidises ethanol to ethanoic acid which in turn destroys the taste of alcoholic drinks.</p>
