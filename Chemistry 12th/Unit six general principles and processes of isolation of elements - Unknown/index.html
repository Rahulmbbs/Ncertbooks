  <p class="red"><em class="calibre9">Thermodynamics illustrates why only a certain reducing element and a minimum specific temperature are suitable for reduction of a metal oxide to the metal in an extraction.</em></p>

  <p class="calibre7">A few elements like carbon, sulphur, gold and noble gases, occur in free state while others in combined forms in the earth’s crust. The extraction and isolation of an element from its combined form involves various principles of chemistry. A particular element may occur in a variety of compounds. The process of metallurgy and isolation should be such that it is chemically feasible and commercially viable. Still, some general principles are common to all the extraction processes of metals. For obtaining a particular metal, first we look for minerals which are naturally occurring chemical substances in the earth’s crust obtainable by mining. Out of many minerals in which a metal may be found, only a few are viable to be used as sources of that metal. Such minerals are known as ores.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">Rarely, an ore contains only a desired substance. It is usually contaminated with earthly or undesired materials known as gangue. The extraction and isolation of metals from ores involve the following major steps:</p>

  <p class="calibre7">• Concentration of the ore,</p>

  <p class="calibre7">• Isolation of the metal from its concentrated ore, and</p>

  <p class="calibre7">• Purification of the metal.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The entire scientific and technological process used for isolation of the metal from its ores is known as metallurgy.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">In the present Unit, first we shall describe various steps for effective concentration of ores. After that we shall discuss the principles of some of the common metallurgical processes. Those principles shall include the thermodynamic and electrochemical aspects involved in the effective reduction of the concentrated ore to the metal.</p>

  <p class="subheading"><strong class="calibre11">6.1 Occurrence of Metals</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">Elements vary in abundance. Among metals, aluminium is the most abundant. It is the third most abundant element in earth’s crust (8.3% approx. by weight). It is a major component of many igneous minerals including mica and clays. Many gemstones are impure forms of Al2O<sub class="calibre10">3</sub> and the impurities range from Cr (in ‘ruby’) to Co (in ‘sapphire’). Iron is the second most abundant metal in the earth’s crust. It forms a variety of compounds and their various uses make it a very important element. It is one of the essential elements in biological systems as well.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The principal ores of aluminium, iron, copper and zinc have been given in Table 6.1.</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre7">For the purpose of extraction, bauxite is chosen for aluminium. For iron, usually the oxide ores which are abundant and do not produce polluting gases (like SO<sub class="calibre10">2</sub> that is produced in case iron pyrites) are taken. For copper and zinc, any of the listed ores (Table 6.1) may be used depending upon availability and other relevant factors. Before proceeding for concentration, ores are graded and crushed to reasonable size.</p>

  <p class="subheading"><strong class="calibre11"><br class="calibre12" /></strong></p>

  <p class="subheading"><strong class="calibre11">6.2. Concentration of Ores</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">Removal of the unwanted materials (e.g., sand, clays, etc.) from the ore is known as concentration, dressing or benefaction. It involves several steps and selection of these steps depends upon the differences in physical properties of the compound of the metal present and that of the gangue. The type of the metal, the available facilities and the environmental factors are also taken into consideration. Some of the important procedures are described below.</p>

  <p class="subheading1"><strong class="calibre8"><br class="calibre3" /></strong></p>

  <p class="subheading1"><strong class="calibre8">6.2.1 Hydraulic Washing</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">This is based on the differences in gravities of the ore and the gangue particles. It is therefore a type of gravity separation. In one such process, an upward stream of running water is used to wash the powdered ore. The lighter gangue particles are washed away and the heavier ores are left behind.</p>

  <p class="subheading1"><strong class="calibre8"><br class="calibre3" /></strong></p>

  <p class="subheading1"><strong class="calibre8">6.2.2 Magnetic Separation</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">This is based on differences in magnetic properties of the ore components. If either the ore or the gangue (one of these two) is capable of being attracted by a magnetic field, then such separations are carried out (e.g., in case of iron ores). The ground ore is carried on a conveyer belt which passes over a magnetic roller (Fig.6.1).</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="images/000009.png" class="calibre17" /></p>

  <p class="caption"><em class="calibre9">Fig. 6.1: Magnetic separation (schematic)</em></p>

  <p class="subheading1"><strong class="calibre8"><br class="calibre3" /></strong></p>

  <p class="subheading1"><strong class="calibre8">6.2.3 Froth Floatation Method</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">This method has been in use for removing gangue from sulphide ores. In this process, a suspension of the powdered ore is made with water. To it, collectors and froth stabilisers are added. Collectors (e. g., pine oils, fatty acids, xanthates, etc.) enhance non-wettability of the mineral particles and froth stabilisers (e. g., cresols, aniline) stabilise the froth.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The mineral particles become wet by oils while the gangue particles by water. A rotating paddle agitates the mixture and draws air in it. As a result, froth is formed which carries the mineral particles. The froth is light and is skimmed off. It is then dried for recovery of the ore particles.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">Sometimes, it is possible to separate two sulphide ores by adjusting proportion of oil to water or by using ‘depressants’. For example, in case of an ore containing ZnS and PbS, the depressant used is NaCN. It selectively prevents ZnS from coming to the froth but allows PbS to come with the froth.</p>

    <p class="calibre7">One can do wonders if he or she has a scientific temperament and is attentive to observations. A washerwoman had an innovative mind too. While washing a miner's overalls, she noticed that sand and similar dirt fell to the bottom of the washtub. What was peculiar, the copper bearing compounds that had come to the clothes from the mines, were caught in the soapsuds and so they came to the top. One of her clients was a chemist, Mrs. Carrie Everson. The washerwoman told her experience to Mrs. Everson. The latter thought that the idea could be used for separating copper compounds from rocky and earth materials on large scale. This way an invention was born. At that time only those ores were used for extraction of copper, which contained large amounts of the metal. Invention of the Froth Floatation Method made copper mining profitable even from the low-grade ores. World production of copper soared and the metal became cheaper.</p>

  <p class="subheading1"><strong class="calibre8">6.2.4 Leaching</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">Leaching is often used if the ore is soluble in some suitable solvent. The following examples illustrate the procedure:</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">(a) Leaching of alumina from bauxite</em></strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">The principal ore of aluminium, bauxite, usually contains SiO<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>, iron oxides and titanium oxide (TiO<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>) as impurities. Concentration is carried out by digesting the powdered ore with a concentrated solution of NaOH at 473 &ndash; 523 K and 35 &ndash; 36 bar pressure. This way, Al<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">3</sub> is leached out as sodium aluminate (and SiO<sub class="calibre10">2</sub> too as sodium silicate) leaving the impurities behind:</p>

  <p class="calibre7">Al<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">3</sub>(s) + 2NaOH(aq) + 3H<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O(l) → 2Na[Al(OH) <sub class="calibre10">4</sub>](aq) (6.1)</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The aluminate in solution is neutralised by passing CO<sub class="calibre10">2</sub> gas and hydrated Al<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">3</sub> is precipitated. At this stage, the solution is seeded with freshly prepared samples of hydrated Al<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">3</sub> which induces the precipitation:</p>

  <p class="calibre7">2Na[Al(OH)<sub class="calibre10">4</sub>](aq) + CO<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>(g) → Al<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">3</sub>.xH<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O(s) + 2NaHCO<sub class="calibre10">3</sub> (aq) (6.2)</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The sodium silicate remains in the solution and hydrated alumina is filtered, dried and heated to give back pure Al<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">3</sub>:</p>

  <p class="calibre7">Al<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">3</sub>.xH<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O(s) <span><img alt="2240.png" src="images/000004.png" class="calibre18" /></span> Al<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">3</sub>(s) + xH<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O(g) (6.3)</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The concentrated ore must be converted into a form which is suitable for reduction. Usually the sulphide ore is converted to oxide before reduction.

  <p class="calibre7">(ii) Roasting: In roasting, the ore is heated in a regular supply of air in a furnace at a temperature below the melting point of the metal. Some of the reactions involving sulphide ores are:</p>

  <p class="calibre7">2ZnS + 3O<sub class="calibre10">2</sub> → 2ZnO + 2SO<sub class="calibre10">2</sub> (6.9)</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">(b) Reduction of oxide to the metal</em></strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">Reduction of the metal oxide usually involves heating it with some other substance acting as a reducing agent (C or CO or even another metal). The reducing agent (e.g., carbon) combines with the oxygen of the metal oxide.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">M<sub class="calibre10">x</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">y</sub> + yC → xM + y CO (6.13)</p>

  <p class="calibre7">Some metal oxides get reduced easily while others are very difficult to be reduced (reduction means electron gain or electronation). In any case, heating is required. To understand the variation in the temperature requirement for thermal reductions (pyrometallurgy) and to predict which element will suit as the reducing agent for a given metal oxide (M<sub class="calibre10">x</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">y</sub>), Gibbs energy interpretations are made.</p>

  <p class="subheading"><strong class="calibre11"><br class="calibre12" /></strong></p>

  <p class="subheading"><strong class="calibre11">6.4 Thermodynamic Principles of metallurgy</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">Some basic concepts of thermodynamics help us in understanding the theory of metallurgical transformations. Gibbs energy is the most significant term here.The change in Gibbs energy, ∆G for any process at any specified temperature, is described by the equation:</p>

  <p class="calibre7">∆G = ∆H &ndash; T∆S (6.14)</p>

  <p class="calibre7">where, ∆H is the enthalpy change and ∆S is the entropy change for the process. For any reaction, this change could also be explained through the equation:</p>

  <p class="calibre7">∆G<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">o</sup></strike> = &ndash; RTlnK (6.15)</p>

  <p class="calibre7">where, K is the equilibrium constant of the ‘reactant &ndash; product’ system at the temperature,T. A negative ∆G implies a +ve K in equation 6.15. And this can happen only when reaction proceeds towards products. From these facts we can make the following conclusions:</p>

  <p class="caption">During metallurgy, ‘flux’ is added which combines with ‘gangue’ to form ‘slag’. Slag separates more easily from the ore than the gangue. This way, removal of gangue becomes easier.</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre7">1. When the value of ∆G is negative in equation 6.14, only then the reaction will proceed. If ∆S is positive, on increasing the temperature (T), the value of T∆S would increase (∆H &lt; T∆S) and then ∆G<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">o</sup></strike> will become &ndash;ve.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">2. If reactants and products of two reactions are put together in a system and the net ∆G of the two possible reactions is &ndash;ve, the overall reaction will occur. So the process of interpretation involves coupling of the two reactions, getting the sum of their ∆G and looking for its magnitude and sign. Such coupling is easily understood through Gibbs energy (∆G) vs T plots for formation of the oxides (Fig. 6.4).</p>

    <p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9"><u class="calibre20">Ellingham Diagram</u></em></strong></p>

    <p class="calibre7">The graphical representation of Gibbs energy was first used by H.J.T.Ellingham This provides a sound basis for considering the choice of reducing agent in the reduction of oxides. This is known as Ellingham Diagram. Such diagrams help us in predicting the feasibility of thermal reduction of an ore. The criterion of feasibility is that at a given temperature, Gibbs energy of the reaction must be negative.</p>

    <p class="calibre7">(a) Ellingham diagram normally consists of plots of Δ<sub class="calibre10">f</sub>G<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">o</sup></strike> vs T for formation of oxides of elements i.e., for the reaction,</p>

    2xM(s) + O<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>(g) → 2M<sub class="calibre10">x</sub>O(s)</p>

    <p class="calibre7">In this reaction, the gaseous amount (hence molecular randomness) is decreasing from left to right due to the consumption of gases leading to a &ndash;ve value of ΔS which changes the sign of the second term in equation (6.14). Subsequently ΔG shifts towards higher side despite rising T (normally, ΔG decreases i.e., goes to lower side with increasing temperature). The result is +ve slope in the curve for most of the reactions shown above for formation of M<sub class="calibre10">x</sub>O(s).</p>

    <p class="calibre7">(b) Each plot is a straight line except when some change in phase (s → liq or liq→ g) takes place. The temperature at which such change occurs, is indicated by an increase in the slope on +ve side (e.g., in the Zn, ZnO plot, the melting is indicated by an abrupt change in the curve).</p>

    <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
    (c) There is a point in a curve below which ΔG is negative (So M<sub class="calibre10">x</sub>O is stable). Above this point, M<sub class="calibre10">x</sub>O will decompose on its own.</p>

    <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
    (d) In an Ellingham diagram, the plots of ΔG<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">o</sup></strike> for oxidation (and therefore reduction of the corresponding species) of common metals and some reducing agents are given. The values of Δ<sub class="calibre10">f</sub> G<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">o</sup></strike>, etc.(for formation of oxides) at different temperatures are depicted which make the interpretation easy.</p>

    <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
    (e) Similar diagrams are also constructed for sulfides and halides and it becomes clear why reductions of M<sub class="calibre10">x</sub>S is difficult. There, the Δ<sub class="calibre10">f</sub> G<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">o</sup></strike> of M<sub class="calibre10">x</sub>S is not compensated.</p>

    <p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8">Limitations of Ellingham Diagram</strong></p>

    <p class="calibre7">1. The graph simply indicates whether a reaction is possible or not i.e., the tendency of reduction with a reducing agent is indicated. This is so because it is based only on the thermodynamic concepts. It does not say about the kinetics of the reduction process (Cannot answer questions like how fast it could be ?).</p>

    <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
    2. The interpretation of ΔGV is based on K (ΔG<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">o</sup></strike> = &ndash; RT lnK). Thus it is presumed that the reactants and products are in equilibrium:</p>

    <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
    M<sub class="calibre10">x</sub>O + A<sub class="calibre10">red</sub> l xM + AO<sub class="calibre10">ox</sub></p>

    <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
    This is not always true because the reactant/product may be solid. [However it explains how the reactions are sluggish when every species is in solid state and smooth when the ore melts down.It is interestng to note here that ΔH (enthalpy change) and the ΔS (entropy change) values for any chemical reaction remain nearly constant even on varying temperature. So the only dominant variable in equation(6.14) becomes T. However, ΔS depends much on the physical state of the compound. Since entropy depends on disorder or randomness in the system, it will increase if a compound melts (s→ l ) or vapourises (l→ g) since molecular randomness increases on changing the phase from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas].</p>
  </div>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre7">The reducing agent forms its oxide when the metal oxide is reduced. The role of reducing agent is to provide ΔG<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">o</sup></strike> negative and large enough to make the sum of ΔGV of the two reactions (oxidation of the reducing agent and reduction of the metal oxide) negative.</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
  As we know, during reduction, the oxide of a metal decomposes:</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
  M<sub class="calibre10">x</sub>O(s) → xM (solid or liq) + 1/2 O<sub class="calibre10">2</sub> (g) (6.16)</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
  The reducing agent takes away the oxygen. Equation 6.16 can be visualised as reverse of the oxidation of the metal. And then, the Δ<sub class="calibre10">f</sub> G<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">o</sup></strike> value is written in the usual way:</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
  xM(s or l) + 1/2 O<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>(g) → M<sub class="calibre10">x</sub>O(s) [ΔG<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">o</sup></strike> <sub class="calibre10">(M,MxO)</sub>] (6.17)</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
  If reduction is being carried out through equation 6.16, the oxidation of the reducing agent (e.g., C or CO) will be there:</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
  C(s) + 1/2 O<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>(g) → CO(g) [ΔG<sub class="calibre10">(C, CO)</sub>] (6.18)</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
  CO(g) + 1/2 O<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>(g) → CO<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>(g) [ΔG<sub class="calibre10">(CO, CO2)</sub>] (6.19)</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
  If carbon is taken, there may also be complete oxidation of the element to CO2:</p>

  <p class="calibre7">1/2 C(s) + 1/2 O<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>(g) → 1/2 CO<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>(g) [ 1/2 ΔG<sub class="calibre10">(C, CO2)</sub>] (6.20)</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
  On subtracting equation 6.17 [it means adding its negative or the reverse form as in equation 6.16] from one of the three equations, we get:</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
  M<sub class="calibre10">x</sub>O(s) + C(s) → xM(s or l) + CO(g) (6.21)</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
  M<sub class="calibre10">x</sub>O(s) + CO(g) → xM(s or l) + CO<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>(g) (6.22)</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
  M<sub class="calibre10">x</sub>O(s) + 1/2 C(s) → xM(s or l) + 1/ 2 CO<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>(g) (6.23)</p>

  <p class="calibre7">These reactions describe the actual reduction of the metal oxide, M<sub class="calibre10">x</sub>O that we want to accomplish. The Δ<sub class="calibre10">r</sub>G<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">0</sup></strike> values for these reactions in general, can be obtained by similar subtraction of the corresponding Δ<sub class="calibre10">f</sub> G<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">0</sup></strike> values.</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
  As we have seen, heating (i.e., increasing T) favours a negative value of Δ<sub class="calibre10">r</sub>G<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">0</sup></strike>. Therefore, the temperature is chosen such that the sum of Δ<sub class="calibre10">r</sub>G<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">0</sup></strike> in the two combined redox process is negative. In Δ<sub class="calibre10">r</sub>G<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">0</sup></strike> vs T plots, this is indicated by the point of intersection of the two curves (curve for M<sub class="calibre10">x</sub>O and that for the oxidation of the reducing substance). After that point, the Δ<sub class="calibre10">r</sub>G<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">0</sup></strike> value becomes more negative for the combined process including the reduction of M<sub class="calibre10">x</sub>O. The difference in the two Δ<sub class="calibre10">r</sub>G<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">0</sup></strike><br class="calibre3" />
  values after that point determines whether reductions of the oxide of the upper line is feasible by the element represented by the lower line. If the difference is large, the reduction is easier.</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">(a) Extraction of iron from its oxides</em></strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">Oxide ores of iron, after concentration through calcination/roasting (to remove water, to decompose carbonates and to oxidise sulphides) are mixed with limestone and coke and fed into a Blast furnace from its top. Here, the oxide is reduced to the metal. Thermodynamics helps us to understand how coke reduces the oxide and why this furnace is chosen. One of the main reduction steps in this process is:</p>

  <p class="calibre7">FeO(s) + C(s) → Fe(s/l) + CO (g) (6.24)</p>

  <p class="calibre7">It can be seen as a couple of two simpler reactions. In one, the reduction of FeO is taking place and in the other, C is being oxidised to CO:</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
  FeO(s) → Fe(s) + 1/2 O<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>(g) [ΔG<sub class="calibre10">(FeO, Fe)</sub>] (6.25)</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
  C(s) + 1/2 O<sub class="calibre10">2</sub> (g) → CO (g) [ΔG <sub class="calibre10">(C, CO)</sub>] (6.26)</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
  When both the reactions take place to yield the equation (6.24), the net Gibbs energy change becomes:</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
  ΔG <sub class="calibre10">(C, CO)</sub> + ΔG <sub class="calibre10">(FeO, Fe)</sub> = Δ<sub class="calibre10">r</sub>G (6.27)</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
  Naturally, the resultant reaction will take place when the right hand side in equation 6.27 is negative. In ΔG<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">0</sup></strike> vs T plot representing reaction 6.25, the plot goes upward and that representing the change C→ CO (C,CO) goes downward. At temperatures above 1073K (approx.), the C,CO line comes below the Fe,FeO line [ΔG (C, CO) &lt; ΔG(Fe, FeO)]. So in this range, coke will be reducing the FeO and will itself be oxidised to CO. In a similar way the reduction of Fe<sub class="calibre10">3</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">4</sub> and Fe<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">3</sub> at relatively lower temperatures by CO can be explained on the basis of lower lying points of intersection of their curves with the CO, CO<sub class="calibre10">2</sub> curve in Fig. 6.4.</p>

  <p class="calibre4"></p>

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre25">In the Blast furnace, reduction of iron oxides takes place in different temperature ranges. Hot air is blown from the bottom of the furnace and coke is burnt to give temperature upto about 2200K in the lower portion itself. The burning of coke therefore supplies most of the heat required in the process. The CO and heat moves to upper part of the furnace. In upper part, the temperature is lower and the iron oxides (Fe<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">3</sub> and Fe<sub class="calibre10">3</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">4</sub>) coming from the top are reduced in steps to FeO.<br class="calibre3" />
  Thus, the reduction reactions taking place in the lower temperature range and in the higher temperature range, depend on the points of corresponding intersections in the Δ<sub class="calibre10">r</sub>G<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">0</sup></strike> vs T plots. These reactions can be summarised as follows:</p>

  <p class="calibre25"></p>

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" />

  <p class="calibre25">Limestone is also decomposed to CaO which removes silicate impurity of the ore as slag. The slag is in molten state and separates out from iron.</p>

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" />
  The iron obtained from Blast furnace contains about 4% carbon and many impurities in smaller amount (e.g., S, P, Si, Mn). This is known as pig iron and cast into variety of shapes. Cast iron is different from pig iron and is made by melting pig iron with scrap iron and coke using hot air blast. It has slightly lower carbon content (about 3%) and is extremely hard and brittle.</p>

  <p class="calibre25">Wrought iron or malleable iron is the purest form of commercial iron and is prepared from cast iron by oxidising impurities in a reverberatory furnace lined with haematite. This haematite oxidises carbon to carbon monoxide:</p>

So it is quite easy to reduce oxide ores of copper directly to the metal by heating with coke (both the lines of C, CO and C, CO<sub class="calibre10">2</sub> are at much lower positions in the graph particularly after 500 &ndash; 600K). However most of the ores are sulphide and some may also contain iron. The sulphide ores are roasted/smelted to give oxides:</p>

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" />
  2Cu<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>S + 3O<sub class="calibre10">2</sub> → 2Cu<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O + 2SO<sub class="calibre10">2</sub> (6.34)</p>

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" />

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" />
  Cu<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O + C → 2 Cu + CO (6.35)</p>

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" />
  In actual process, the ore is heated in a reverberatory furnace after mixing with silica. In the furnace, iron oxide 'slags of' as iron silicate and copper is produced in the form of copper matte. This contains Cu<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>S and FeS.<br class="calibre3" />

  <p class="calibre25">We have seen how principles of thermodyamics are applied to pyrometallurgy. Similar principles are effective in the reductions of metal ions in solution or molten state. Here they are reduced by electrolysis or by adding some reducing element.</p>

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" />
  In the reduction of a molten metal salt, electrolysis is done. Such methods are based on electrochemical principles which could be understood through the equation,</p>

  here n is the number of electrons and E<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">0</sup></strike> is the electrode potential of the redox couple formed in the system.

  <p class="calibre25">This process of electrolysis is widely known as Hall-Heroult process.</p>

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" />
  Thus electrolysis of the molten mass is carried out in an electrolytic cell using carbon electrodes. The oxygen liberated at anode reacts with the carbon of anode producing CO and CO<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>. This way for each kg of aluminium produced, about 0.5 kg of carbon anode is burnt away. The electrolytic reactions are:</p>

  <p class="calibre25">Besides reductions, some extractions are based on oxidation particularly for non-metals. A very common example of extraction based on oxidation is the extraction of chlorine from brine (chlorine is abundant in sea water as common salt) .</p>

When it is converted to E0 (using ΔG<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">0</sup></strike> = &ndash; nE<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">0</sup></strike>F), we get E<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">0</sup></strike> = &ndash; 2.2 V. Naturally, it will require an external e.m.f. that is greater than 2.2 V. But the electrolysis requires an excess potential to overcome some other hindering reactions. Thus, Cl2 is obtained by electrolysis giving out H<sub class="calibre10">2</sub> and aqueous NaOH as byproducts. Electrolysis of molten NaCl is also carried out. But in that case, Na metal is produced and not NaOH.</p>

  <p class="subheading"><strong class="calibre11"><em class="calibre29">6.7 Refining</em></strong></p>

  <p class="calibre25">A metal extracted by any method is usually contaminated with some impurity. For obtaining metals of high purity, several techniques are used depending upon the differences in properties of the metal and the impurity. Some of them are listed below.</p>

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" />
  (a) Distillation (b) Liquation<br class="calibre3" />
  (c) Electrolysis (d) Zone refining<br class="calibre3" />
  (e) Vapour phase refining (f ) Chromatographic methods</p>

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" />
  These are described in detail here.</p>

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" />
  <em class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre8">(a) Distillation</strong></em></p>

  <p class="calibre25">This is very useful for low boiling metals like zinc and mercury. The impure metal is evaporated to obtain the pure metal as distillate.<br class="calibre3" />
  <em class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre8"><br class="calibre3" />
  (b) Liquation</strong></em><br class="calibre3" />
  In this method a low melting metal like tin can be made to flow on a sloping surface. In this way it is separated from higher melting impurities.</p>

  <p class="calibre25"></p>

  <p class="calibre25"><strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">(c) Electrolytic refining</em></strong></p>

  <p class="calibre25">In this method, the impure metal is made to act as anode. A strip of the same metal in pure form is used as cathode. They are put in a suitable electrolytic bath containing soluble salt of the same metal. The more basic metal remains in the solution and the less basic ones go to the anode mud. This process is also explained using the concept of electrode potential, over potential, and Gibbs energy which you have seen in previous sections. The reactions are:</p>

  <p class="calibre25"></p>

  <p class="calibre25">Anode: M → Mn<sup class="calibre21">+</sup> + ne<sup class="calibre21">&ndash;</sup></p>

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" />
  Cathode: Mn<sup class="calibre21">+</sup> + ne<sup class="calibre21">&ndash;</sup> → M (6.52)</p>

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" />
  Copper is refined using an electrolytic method. Anodes are of impure copper and pure copper strips are taken as cathode. The electrolyte is acidified solution of copper sulphate and the net result of electrolysis is the transfer of copper in pure form from the anode to the cathode:</p>

  <p class="calibre25"></p>

  <p class="calibre25">Anode: Cu → Cu<sup class="calibre21">2+</sup> + 2 e<sup class="calibre21">&ndash;</sup></p>

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" />
  Cathode: Cu<sup class="calibre21">2+</sup> + 2e<sup class="calibre21">&ndash;</sup> → Cu (6.53)</p>

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" />
  Impurities from the blister copper deposit as anode mud which contains antimony, selenium, tellurium, silver, gold and platinum; recovery of these elements may meet the cost of refining.</p>

  <p class="calibre25"></p>

  <p class="calibre25">Zinc may also be refined this way.</p>

  <p class="calibre25"></p>

  <p class="calibre25"><em class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre8">(d) Zone refining</strong></em></p>

  <p class="calibre25">This method is based on the principle that the impurities are more soluble in the melt than in the solid state of the metal. A circular mobile heater is fixed at one end of a rod of the impure metal (Fig. 6.7). The molten zone moves along with the heater which is moved forward. As the heater moves forward, the pure metal crystallises out of the melt and the impurities pass on into the adjacent molten zone. The process is repeated several times and the heater is moved in the same direction. At one end, impurities get concentrated. This end is cut off. This method is very useful for producing semiconductor and other metals of very high purity, e.g., germanium, silicon, boron, gallium and indium.</p>

  <p class="calibre25"><strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">(e) Vapour phase refining</em></strong></p>

  <p class="calibre25">In this method, the metal is converted into its volatile compound and collected elsewhere. It is then decomposed to give pure metal. So, the two requirements are:</p>

  <p class="calibre25">(i) the metal should form a volatile compound with an available reagent,</p>

  <p class="calibre25">(ii) the volatile compound should be easily decomposable, so that the recovery is easy.</p>

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" />
  Following examples will illustrate this technique.</p>

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" />
  Mond Process for Refining Nickel: In this process, nickel is heated in a stream of carbon monoxide forming a volatile complex, nickel tetracarbonyl:</p>

  The carbonyl is subjected to higher temperature so that it is decomposed giving the pure metal:</p>

  <p class="calibre25">van Arkel Method for Refining Zirconium or Titanium: This method is very useful for removing all the oxygen and nitrogen present in the form of impurity in certain metals like Zr and Ti. The crude metal is heated in an evacuated vessel with iodine. The metal iodide being more covalent, volatilises:</p>

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" />
  Zr + 2I<sub class="calibre10">2</sub> → ZrI<sub class="calibre10">4</sub> (6.56)</p>

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" />
  The metal iodide is decomposed on a tungsten filament, electrically heated to about 1800K. The pure metal is thus deposited on the filament.</p>

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" />
  ZrI<sub class="calibre10">4</sub> → Zr + 2I<sub class="calibre10">2</sub> (6.57)</p>

  <p class="calibre25"><br class="calibre3" />
  <em class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre8">(f) Chromatographic methods</strong></em></p>

  <p class="calibre25">This method is based on the principle that different components of a mixture are differently adsorbed on an adsorbent. The mixture is put in a liquid or gaseous medium which is moved through the adsorbent. Different components are adsorbed at different levels on the column. Later the adsorbed components are removed (eluted) by using suitable solvents (eluant). Depending upon the physical state of the moving medium and the adsorbent material and also on the process of passage of the moving medium, the chromatographic method* is given the name. In one such method the column of Al<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">3</sub> is prepared in a glass tube and the moving medium containing a solution of the components is in liquid form. This is an example of column chromatography. This is very useful for purification of the elements which are available in minute quantities and the impurities are not very different in chemical properties from the element to be purified. There are several chromatographic techniques such as paper chromatography, column chromatography, gas chromatography, etc. Procedures followed in column chromatography have been depicted in Fig. 6.8.</p>

    <p class="caption">*Looking it the other way, chromatography in general, involves a mobile phase and a stationary phase. The sample or sample extract is dissolved in a mobile phase. The mobile phase may be a gas, a liquid or a supercritical fluid. The stationary phase is immobile and immiscible (like the Al 2 O 3 column in the example of column chromatography above). The mobile phase is then forced through the stationary phase. The mobile phase and the stationary phase are chosen such that components of the sample have different solubilities in the two phases. A component which is quite soluble in the stationary phase takes longer time to travel through it than a component which is not very soluble in the stationary phase but very soluble in the mobile phase. Thus sample components are separated from each other as they travel through the stationary phase. Depending upon the two phases and the way sample is inserted/injected, the chromatographic technique is named. These methods have been described in detail in Unit 12 of Class XI text book (12.8.5).</p>

    <p class="calibre25"></p>

    <p class="calibre25">Metals are required for a variety of purposes. For this, we need their extraction from the minerals in which they are present and from which their extraction is commercially feasible.These minerals are known as ores. Ores of the metal are associated with many impurities. Removal of these impurities to certain extent is achieved in concentration steps. The concentrated ore is then treated chemically for obtaining the metal. Usually the metal compounds (e.g., oxides, sulphides) are reduced to the metal. The reducing agents used are carbon, CO or even some metals. In these reduction processes, the thermodynamic and electrochemical concepts are given due consideration. The metal oxide reacts with a reducing agent; the oxide is reduced to the metal and the reducing agent is oxidised. In the two reactions, the net Gibbs energy change is negative, which becomes more negative on raising the temperature. Conversion of the physical states from solid to liquid or to gas, and formation of gaseous states favours decrease in the Gibbs energy for the entire system. This concept is graphically displayed in plots of ΔG<strike class="calibre22"><sup class="calibre21">0</sup></strike> vs T (Ellingham diagram) for such oxidation/reduction reactions at different temperatures. The concept of electrode potential is useful in the isolation of metals (e.g., Al, Ag, Au) where the sum of the two redox couples is +ve so that the Gibbs energy change is negative. The metals obtained by usual methods still contain minor impurities. Getting pure metals require refining. Refining process depends upon the differences in properties of the metal and the impurities. Extraction of aluminium is usually carried out from its bauxite ore by leaching it with NaOH. Sodium aluminate, thus formed, is separated and then neutralised to give back the hydrated oxide, which is then electrolysed using cryolite as a flux. Extraction of iron is done by reduction of its oxide ore in blast furnace. Copper is extracted by smelting and heating in a reverberatory furnace. Extraction of zinc from zinc oxides is done using coke. Several methods are emplO<sub class="calibre10">y</sub>ed n refining the metal. Metals, in general, are very widely used and have contributed significantly in the development of a variety of industries.</p>
