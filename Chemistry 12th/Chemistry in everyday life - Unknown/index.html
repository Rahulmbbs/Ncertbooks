  <p class="calibre8">By now, you have learnt the basic principles of chemistry and also realised that it influences every sphere of human life. The principles of chemistry have&nbsp;been used for the benefit of mankind. Think of cleanliness &mdash; the materials like soaps, detergents, household bleaches, tooth pastes, etc. will come to your&nbsp;mind. Look towards the beautiful clothes &mdash; immediately chemicals of the synthetic fibres used for making clothes and chemicals giving colours to them will come to your mind. Food materials &mdash; again a number of chemicals about which you have learnt in the previous Unit will appear in your mind. Of course, sickness and diseases remind us of medicines &mdash; again chemicals. Explosives, fuels, rocket propellents, building and electronic materials, etc., are all chemicals. Chemistry has influenced our life so much that we do not even realise that we come across chemicals at every moment; that we ourselves are beautiful chemical creations and all our activities are controlled by chemicals. In this Unit, we shall learn the application of Chemistry in three&nbsp;important and interesting areas, namely &ndash; medicines, food materials and cleansing agents.</p>

  <p class="calibre8"><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <h5 class="calibre11"><strong class="calibre12">16.1 Drugs and their Classification</strong></h5>

  <p class="calibre8">Drugs are chemicals of low molecular masses (~100 &ndash; 500u). These interact with macromolecular targets and produce a biological response. When the biological response is therapeutic and useful, these chemicals are called medicines and are used in diagnosis, prevention and treatment of diseases. If taken in doses higher than those recommended, most of the drugs used as medicines are potential poisons. Use of chemicals for therapeutic effect is called <b class="calibre6">chemotherapy</b>,</p>

  <p class="calibre8"><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <h6 class="calibre13"><strong class="calibre14">16.1.1 Classification of Drugs</strong></h6>

  <p class="calibre8">Drugs can be classified mainly on criteria outlined as follows:</p>

  <p class="calibre8"><strong class="calibre14">(a) On the basis of pharmacological effect</strong><br class="calibre3" />
  This classification is based on pharmacological effect of the drugs. It is useful for doctors because it provides them the whole range of drugs available for the treatment of a particular type of problem. For example, analgesics have pain killing effect, antiseptics kill or arrest the growth of microorganisms.</p>

  <p class="calibre8"><br class="calibre3" />
  <strong class="calibre14">(b) On the basis of drug action</strong><br class="calibre3" />
  It is based on the action of a drug on a particular biochemical process. For example, all antihistamines inhibit the action of the compound, histamine which causes inflammation in the body. There are various ways in which action of histamines can be blocked. You will learn about this in Section 16.3.2.</p>

  <p class="calibre8"><br class="calibre3" />
  <strong class="calibre14">(c) On the basis of chemical structure</strong><br class="calibre3" />
  It is based on the chemical structure of the drug. Drugs classified in this way share common structural features and often have similar pharmacological activity. For example, sulphonamides have common structural feature, given below.</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="images/000005.PNG" class="calibre15" /></p>

  <div class="calibre17">
    <strong class="calibre18">(d) On the basis of molecular targets</strong>
  </div>

  <div class="calibre17">
    <span class="calibre19">Drugs usually interact with biomolecules such as carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. These are called target molecules or drug targets. Drugs possessing some common structural features may have the same mechanism of action on targets. The classification based on molecular targets is the most useful classification for medicinal chemists.</span>

  <h5 class="calibre20"><strong class="calibre12">16.2 Drug-Target Interaction</strong></h5>

  <p class="calibre16">Macromolecules of biological origin perform various functions in the body. For example, proteins which perform the role of biological catalysts in the body are called enzymes, those which are crucial to communication system in the body are called receptors. Carrier proteins carry polar molecules across the cell membrane. Nucleic acids have coded genetic information for the cell. Lipids and carbohydrates are structural parts of the cell membrane. We shall explain the drug-target interaction with the examples of enzymes and receptors.</p>

  <h6 class="calibre22"><strong class="calibre14">16.2.1 Enzymes as Drug Targets</strong></h6>

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <p class="calibre16"><strong class="calibre14">(a) Catalytic action of enzymes</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre16">For understanding the interaction between a drug and an enzyme, it is important to know how do enzymes catalyse the reaction (Section 5.2.4). In their catalytic activity, enzymes perform two major functions:</p>

  <div class="calibre17">
    <span class="calibre19">(i) The first function of an enzyme is to hold the substrate for a chemical reaction. Active sites of enzymes hold the substrate molecule in a suitable osition, so that it can be attacked by the reagent effectively. Substrates bind to the active site of the enzyme through a variety of interactions such as ionic bonding, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interaction or dipole-dipole interaction (Fig. 16.1).</span>
  </div>

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <p class="calibre16"><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre16">(ii) The second function of an enzyme is to provide functional groups that will attack the substrate and carry out chemical reaction.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="calibre17">
    <span class="calibre19">Drugs inhibit any of the above mentioned activities of enzymes. These can block the binding site of the enzyme and prevent the binding of substrate, or can inhibit the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Such drugs are called enzyme inhibitors.</span>

  <h6 class="calibre22"><strong class="calibre14"><br class="calibre3" /></strong></h6>

  <h6 class="calibre22"><strong class="calibre14">16.2.2 Receptors as Drug Targets</strong></h6>

  <p class="calibre16">Receptors are proteins that are crucial to body's communication process. Majority of these are embedded in cell membranes (Fig. 16.4). Receptor proteins are embedded in the cell membrane in such a way that their small part possessing active site projects out of the surface of the membrane and opens on the outside region of the cell membrane (Fig. 16.4).</p>

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="images/000022.PNG" class="calibre27" /></p>

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <p class="calibre16">In the body, message between two neurons and that between neurons to muscles is communicated through certain chemicals. These chemicals, known as chemical messengers are received at the binding sites of receptor proteins. To accommodate a messenger, shape of the receptor site changes. This brings about the transfer of message into the cell. Thus, chemical messenger gives message to the cell without entering the cell (Fig. 16.5).</p>

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <p class="calibre16"><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre16">There are a large number of different receptors in the body that interact with different chemical messengers. These receptors show selectivity for one chemical messenger over the other because their binding sites have different shape, structure and amino acid composition.</p>

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <p class="calibre16">Drugs that bind to the receptor site and inhibit its natural function are called antagonists. These are useful when blocking of message is required. There are other types of drugs that mimic the natural messenger by switching on the receptor, these are called agonists. These are useful when there is lack of natural chemical messenger.</p>

  <h5 class="calibre20"><strong class="calibre12">16.3 Therapeutic Action of Different Classes of Drugs</strong></h5>

  <p class="calibre16">In this Section, we shall discuss the therapeutic action of a few important classes of drugs.</p>

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <h6 class="calibre22"><strong class="calibre14"><br class="calibre3" /></strong></h6>

  <h6 class="calibre22"><strong class="calibre14">16.3.1 Antacids</strong></h6>

  <p class="calibre16">Over production of acid in the stomach causes irritation and pain. In severe cases, ulcers are developed in the stomach. Until 1970, only treatment for acidity was administration of antacids, such as sodium hydrogencarbonate or a mixture of aluminium and magnesium hydroxide. However, excessive hydrogencarbonate can make the stomach alkaline and trigger the production of even more acid. Metal hydroxides are better alternatives because of being insoluble, these do not increase the pH above neutrality. These treatments control only symptoms, and not the cause. Therefore, with these metal salts, the patients cannot be treated easily. In advanced stages, ulcers become life threatening and its only treatment is removal of the affected part of the stomach.</p>

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <div class="calibre17">
    <br class="calibre3" />
  </div>

  <div class="calibre17">
    <span class="calibre19">A major breakthrough in the treatment of hyperacidity came through the discovery according to which a chemical, histamine, stimulates the secretion of pepsin and hydrochloric acid in the stomach. The drug cimetidine (Tegamet), was designed to prevent the interaction of histamine with the receptors present in the stomach wall. This resulted in release of lesser amount of acid. The importance of the drug was so much that it remained the largest selling drug in the world until another drug, ranitidine (Zantac), was discovered.</span>

  <h6 class="calibre22"><strong class="calibre14">16.3.2 Antihistamines</strong></h6>

  <p class="calibre16">Histamine is a potent vasodilator. It has various functions. It contracts the smooth muscles in the bronchi and gut and relaxes other muscles, such as those in the walls of fine blood vessels. Histamine is also responsible for the nasal congestion associated with common cold and allergic response to pollen.</p>

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <div class="calibre17">
    <br class="calibre3" />
  </div>

  <div class="calibre17">
    <span class="calibre19">Synthetic drugs, brompheniramine (Dimetapp) and terfenadine (Seldane), act as antihistamines. They interfere with the natural action of histamine by competing with histamine for binding sites of receptor where histamine exerts its effect.</span>
  </div>

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <div class="calibre17">
    <br class="calibre3" />
  </div>

  <div class="calibre17">
    <span class="calibre19">Now the question that arises is, "Why do above mentioned antihistamines not affect the secretion of acid in stomach?" The reason is that antiallergic and antacid drugs work on different receptors.</span>

  <p class="calibre16"><strong class="calibre14">(a) Tranquilizers</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre16"><b class="calibre6">Tranquilizers</b> and <b class="calibre6">analgesics</b> are neurologically active drugs. These affect the message transfer mechanism from nerve to receptor.</p>

    <br class="calibre3" />
  </div>

  <div class="calibre17">
    <span class="calibre19">Tranquilizers are a class of chemical compounds used for the treatment of stress, and mild or even severe mental diseases. These relieve anxiety, stress, irritability or excitement by inducing a sense of well-being. They form an essential component of sleeping pills. There are various types of tranquilizers. They function by different mechanisms. For example, noradrenaline is one of the neurotransmitters that plays a role in mood changes. If the level of</span> noradrenaline is low for some reason, then the signal-sending activity becomes low, and the person suffers from depression. In such situations,<b class="calibre6">antidepressant drugs</b> are required. These drugs inhibit the enzymes which catalyse the degradation of noradrenaline. If the enzyme is inhibited, this important neurotransmitter is slowly metabolised and can activate its receptor for longer periods of time, thus counteracting the effect of depression. Iproniazid and phenelzine are two such drugs.

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <p class="calibre16">Some tranquilizers namely, chlordiazepoxide and meprobamate, are relatively mild tranquilizers suitable for relieving tension. Equanil is used in controlling depression and hypertension.</p>

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <p class="calibre16">Derivatives of barbituric acid viz., veronal, amytal, nembutal, luminal and seconal constitute an important class of tranquilizers. These derivatives are called <b class="calibre6">barbiturates</b>. Barbiturates are hypnotic, i.e., sleep producing agents. Some other substances used as tranquilizers are valium and serotonin.</p>

  <div class="calibre17">
    <span class="calibre19"><b class="calibre6">(i) Non-narcotic (non-addictive) analgesics</b>: Aspirin and paracetamol belong to the class of non-narcotic analgesics. Aspirin is the most familiar example. Aspirin inhibits the synthesis of chemicals known as prostaglandins which stimulate inflammation in the tissue and cause pain. These drugs are effective&nbsp;</span>in relieving skeletal pain such as that due to arthritis. These drugs have many other effects such as reducing fever (antipyretic) and preventing platelet coagulation. Because of its anti blood clotting action, aspirin finds use in prevention of heart attacks.
  </div>

  <p class="calibre16"><b class="calibre6">(ii) Narcotic analgesics</b>: Morphine and many of its homologues, when administered in medicinal doses, relieve pain and produce sleep.

  <p class="calibre16">Diseases in human beings and animals may be caused by a variety of microorganisms such as bacteria, virus, fungi and other pathogens. An antimicrobial tends to destroy/prevent development or inhibit the pathogenic action of microbes such as bacteria (antibacterial drugs), fungi (antifungal agents), virus (antiviral agents), or other parasites (antiparasitic drugs) selectively. Antibiotics, antiseptics and disinfectants are antimicrobial drugs.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="calibre17">
    <span class="calibre19">Antibiotics are used as drugs to treat infections because of their low toxicity for humans and animals. Initially antibiotics were classified as chemical substances produced by microorganisms (bacteria, fungi and molds) that inhibit the growth or even destroy microorganisms. The development of synthetic methods has helped in synthesising some of the compounds that were originally discovered as products of microorganisms. Also, some purely synthetic compounds have antibacterial activity, and therefore, definition of antibiotic has been modified. An antibiotic now refers to a substance produced wholly or&nbsp;</span>partly by chemical synthesis, which in low concentrations inhibits the growth or destroys microorganisms by intervening in their metabolic processes.

  <div class="calibre17">
    <span class="calibre19">The search for chemicals that would adversely affect invading bacteria but not the host began in the nineteenth century. Paul Ehrlich, a German bacteriologist, conceived this idea. He investigated arsenic based structures in order to produce less toxic substances for the treatment of syphilis. He developed the medicine, arsphenamine, known as salvarsan. Paul Ehrlich got Nobel prize for Medicine in 1908 for this discovery. It was the first effective treatment discovered for syphilis. Although salvarsan is toxic to human beings, its effect on the bacteria, spirochete, which causes syphilis is much greater than on human beings. At the same time, Ehrlich was working on azodyes also. He noted that there is similarity in structures of salvarsan and azodyes. The &ndash;As = As&ndash; linkage present in arsphenamine resembles the &ndash;N = N &ndash; linkage present in azodyes in the sense that arsenic atom is present in place of nitrogen. He also noted tissues getting coloured by dyes selectively. Therefore, Ehrlich began to search for the compounds which resemble in structure to azodyes and selectively bind to bacteria. In 1932, he succeeded in preparing the first effective antibacterial agent, prontosil, which resembles in structure to the compound, salvarsan. Soon it was discovered that in the body prontosil is converted to a compound called sulphanilamide, which is the real&nbsp;</span>active compound. Thus the sulpha drugs were discovered. A large range of sulphonamide analogues was synthesised. One of the most effective is sulphapyridine.

  <p class="calibre16">The range of bacteria or other microorganisms that are affected by a certain antibiotic is expressed as its spectrum of action. Antibiotics which kill or inhibit a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are said to be <b class="calibre6">broad spectrum antibiotics</b>. Those effective mainly against Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria are <b class="calibre6">narrow spectrum antibiotics</b>. If effective against a single organism or disease, they are referred to as <b class="calibre6">limited spectrum antibiotics</b>. Penicillin G has a narrow spectrum. Ampicillin and Amoxycillin are synthetic modifications of penicillins. These have broad spectrum. It is absolutely essential to test the patients for sensitivity (allergy) to penicillin before it is administered. In India, penicillin is manufactured at the Hindustan Antibiotics in Pimpri and in private sector industry.</p>

Birth control pills essentially contain a mixture of synthetic estrogen and progesterone derivatives. Both of these compounds are hormones. It is known that progesterone suppresses ovulation. Synthetic progesterone derivatives are more potent than progesterone. Norethindrone is an example of synthetic progesterone derivative most widely used as antifertility drug. The estrogen derivative which is used in combination with progesterone derivative is ethynylestradiol (novestrol).

  <p class="calibre16">Natural sweeteners, e.g., sucrose add to calorie intake and therefore many people prefer to use artificial sweeteners. Ortho-sulphobenzimide, also called saccharin, is the first popular artificial sweetening agent. It has been used as a sweetening agent ever since it was discovered in 1879. It is about 550 times as sweet as cane sugar. It is excreted from the body in urine unchanged. It appears to be entirely inert and harmless when taken. Its use is of great value to diabetic persons and people who need to control intake of calories. Some other commonly marketed artificial sweeteners are given in Table 16.1.</p>

  <p class="calibre16">In this Section, we will learn about detergents. Two types of detergents are used as cleansing agents. These are soaps and synthetic detergents. These improve cleansing properties of water. These help in removal of fats which bind other materials to the fabric or skin.</p>

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <p class="calibre16">Soaps are the detergents used since long. Soaps used for cleaning purpose are sodium or potassium salts of long chain fatty acids, e.g., stearic, oleic and palmitic acids. Soaps containing sodium salts are formed by heating fat (i.e., glyceryl ester of fatty acid) with aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. This reaction is known as saponification.</p>

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <p class="calibre16">In this reaction, esters of fatty acids are hydrolysed and the soap obtained remains in colloidal form. It is precipitated from the solution by adding sodium chloride. The solution left after removing the soap contains glycerol, which can be recovered by fractional distillation. Only sodium and potassium soaps are soluble in water and are used for cleaning purposes. Generally potassium soaps are soft to the skin than sodium soaps. These can be prepared by using potassium hydroxide solution in place of sodium hydroxide.</p>

  <div class="calibre17">
    <span class="calibre19">In medicated soaps, substances of medicinal value are added. In some soaps, deodorants are added. Shaving soaps contain glycerol to prevent rapid drying. A gum called, rosin is added while making them. It forms sodium rosinate which lathers well. Laundry soaps contain fillers like sodium rosinate, sodium silicate, borax and sodium carbonate.</span>
  </div>

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <p class="calibre16">Soap chips are made by running a thin sheet of melted soap onto a cool cylinder and scraping off the soaps in small broken pieces. Soap granules are dried miniature soap bubbles. Soap powders and scouring soaps contain some soap, a scouring agent (abrasive) such as powdered pumice or finely divided sand, and builders like sodium carbonate and trisodium phosphate. Builders make the soaps act more rapidly. The cleansing action of soap has been discussed in Unit 5.</p>

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <p class="calibre16">These insoluble soaps separate as scum in water and are useless as cleansing agent. In fact these are hinderance to good washing, because the precipitate adheres onto the fibre of the cloth as gummy mass. Hair washed with hard water looks dull because of this sticky precipitate. Dye does not absorb evenly on cloth washed with soap using hard water, because of this gummy mass.</p>

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <h5 class="calibre20"><strong class="calibre12"><br class="calibre21" /></strong></h5>

  <h5 class="calibre20"><strong class="calibre12">16.5.2 Synthetic Detergents</strong></h5>

  <p class="calibre16">Synthetic detergents are cleansing agents which have all the properties of soaps, but which actually do not contain any soap. These can be used both in soft and hard water as they give foam even in hard water. Some of the detergents give foam even in ice cold water.</p>

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <p class="calibre16">Synthetic detergents are mainly classified into three categories: (i) Anionic detergents (ii) Cationic detergents and (iii) Non-ionic detergents</p>

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <div class="calibre17">
    <br class="calibre3" />
  </div>

  <div class="calibre17">
    <span class="calibre19">(i) Anionic Detergents: Anionic detergents are sodium salts of sulphonated long chain alcohols or hydrocarbons. Alkyl hydrogensulphates formed by treating long chain alcohols with concentrated sulphuric acid are neutralised with alkali to form anionic detergents. Similarly alkyl benzene sulphonates are</span>

  <p class="calibre16"><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre16">In anionic detergents, the anionic part of the molecule is involved in the cleansing action. Sodium salts of alkylbenzenesulphonates are an important class of anionic detergents.</p>

    <span class="calibre19">(ii) Cationic Detergents: Cationic detergents are quarternary ammonium salts of amines with acetates, chlorides or bromides as anions. Cationic part&nbsp;</span>possess a long hydrocarbon chain and a positive charge on nitrogen atom. Hence, these are called cationic detergents. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide is a popular cationic detergent and is used in hair conditioners.
  </div>

  <p class="calibre16"></p>

  <p class="calibre16">Cationic detergents have germicidal properties and are expensive, therefore, these are of limited use.</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="images/000004.PNG" class="calibre48" /></p>

  <p class="calibre16">(iii) Non-ionic Detergents: Non-ionic detergents do not contain any ion in their constitution. One such detergent is formed when stearic acid reacts with polyethyleneglycol.</p>
