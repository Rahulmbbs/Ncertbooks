  <p class="red"><em class="calibre9">Iron, copper, silver and gold are among the transition elements that have played important roles in the development of human civilisation. The inner transition elements such as Th, Pa and U are proving excellent sources of nuclear energy in modern times.</em></p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre7">The d-block of the periodic table contains the elements of the groups 3-12 in which the d orbitals are progressively filled in each of the four long periods. The elements constituting the f -block are those in which the 4 f and 5 f orbitals are progressively filled in the latter two long periods; these elements are formal members of group 3 from which they have been taken out to form a separate f-block of the periodic table. The names transition metals and inner transition metals are often used to refer to the elements of d-and f-blocks respectively.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">There are mainly three series of the transition metals, 3d series (Sc to Zn), 4d series (Y to Cd) and 5d series (La to Hg, omitting Ce to Lu). The fourth 6d series which begins with Ac is still incomplete. The two series of the inner transition metals, (4f and 5f) are known as lanthanoids and actinoids respectively.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">Strictly speaking, a transition element is defined as the one which has incompletely filled d orbitals in its ground state or in any one of its oxidation states. Zinc, cadmium and mercury of group 12 have full d<sup class="calibre11">10</sup> configuration in their ground state as well as in their common oxidation states and hence, are not regarded as transition metals. However, being the end members of the three transition series, their chemistry is studied along with the chemistry of the transition metals.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The presence of partly filled d or f orbitals in their atoms sets the study of the transition elements and their compounds apart from that of the main group elements. However, the usual theory of valence as applicable to the main group elements can also be applied successfully to the transition elements.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">Various precious metals such as silver, gold and platinum and industrially important metals like iron, copper and titanium form part of the transition metals.</p>

  <p class="subheading1">THE TRANSITION ELEMENTS (d-BLOCK)</p>

  <p class="subheading"><strong class="calibre8">8.1 Position in the Periodic Table</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">The d&ndash;block occupies the large middle section flanked by s&ndash; and p&ndash; blocks in the periodic table. The very name ‘transition’ given to the elements of d-block is only because of their position between s&ndash; and p&ndash; block elements. The d&ndash;orbitals of the penultimate energy level in their atoms receive electrons giving rise to the three rows of the transition metals, i.e., 3d, 4d and 5d. The fourth row of 6d is still incomplete. These series of the transition elements are shown in Table 8.1.</p>

  <p class="subheading"><strong class="calibre8"><br class="calibre3" /></strong></p>

  <p class="subheading"><strong class="calibre8">8.2 Electronic Configurations of the d-Block Elements</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">In general the electronic configuration of these elements is (n-1)d1&ndash;10ns1&ndash;2. The (n&ndash;1) stands for the inner d orbitals which may have one to ten electrons and the outermost ns orbital may have one or two electrons. However, this generalisation has several exceptions because of very little energy difference between (n-1)d and ns orbitals. Furthermore, half and completely filled sets of orbitals are relatively more stable. A consequence of this factor is reflected in the electronic configurations of Cr and Cu in the 3d series. Consider the case of Cr, for example, which has 3d5 4s1 instead of 3d44s2; the energy gap between the two sets (3d and 4s) of orbitals is small enough to prevent electron entering the 3d orbitals. Similarly in case of Cu, the configuration is 3d<sup class="calibre11">10</sup>4s1 and not 3d94s2. The outer electronic configurations of the transition elements are given in Table 8.1.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The electronic configurations of Zn, Cd and Hg are represented by the general formula (n-1)d<sup class="calibre11">10</sup>ns<sup class="calibre11">2</sup>. The orbitals in these elements are completely filled in the ground state as well as in their common oxidation states. Therefore, they are not regarded as transition elements.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The d orbitals of the transition elements project to the periphery of an atom more than the other orbitals (i.e., s and p), hence, they are more influenced by the surroundings as well as affecting the atoms or molecules surrounding them. In some respects, ions of a given dn configuration (n = 1 &ndash; 9) have similar magnetic and electronic properties. With partly filled d orbitals these elements exhibit certain characteristic properties such as display of a variety of oxidation states, formation of coloured ions and entering into complex formation with a variety of ligands.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The transition metals and their compounds also exhibit catalytic property and paramagnetic behaviour. All these characteristics have been discussed in detail later in this Unit.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">There are greater horizontal similarities in the properties of the transition elements in contrast to the main group elements. However, some group similarities also exist. We shall first study the general characteristics and their trends in the horizontal rows (particularly 3d row) and then consider some group similarities.</p>

  <p class="subheading2"><strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">8.3.1 Physical Properties</em></strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">Nearly all the transition elements display typical metallic properties such as high tensile strength, ductility, malleability, high thermal and electrical conductivity and metallic lustre. With the exceptions of Zn, Cd, Hg and Mn, they have one or more typical metallic structures at normal temperatures.</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre9"><br class="calibre3" /></em></p>

  <p class="calibre7">The transition metals (with the exception of Zn, Cd and Hg) are very much hard and have low volatility. Their melting and boiling points are high. Fig. 8.1 depicts the melting points of the 3d, 4d and 5d transition metals. The high melting points of these metals are attributed to the involvement of greater number of electrons from (n-1)d in addition to the ns electrons in the interatomic metallic bonding. In any row the melting points of these metals rise to a maximum at d<sup class="calibre11">5</sup> except for anomalous values of Mn and Tc and fall regularly as the atomic number increases. They have high enthalpies of atomisation which are shown in Fig. 8.2. The maxima at about the middle of each series indicate that one unpaired electron per d orbital is particularly favourable for strong interatomic interaction. In general, greater the number of valence electrons, stronger is the resultant bonding. Since the enthalpy of atomisation is an important factor in determining the standard electrode potential of a metal, metals with very high enthalpy of atomisation (i.e., very high boiling point) tend to be noble in their reactions (see later for electrode potentials).</p>

  <p class="caption"><em class="calibre9">Fig. 8.1: Trends in melting points of transition elements</em></p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre7">Another generalisation that may be drawn from Fig. 8.2 is that the metals of the second and third series have greater enthalpies of atomisation than the corresponding elements of the first series; this is an important factor in accounting for the occurrence of much more frequent metal &ndash; metal bonding in compounds of the heavy transition metals.</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="" heigh="466" src="images/000000.PNG" class="calibre12" /></p>

  <p class="caption">Fig. 8.2 Trends in enthalpies of atomisation of transition elements</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre7">In general, ions of the same charge in a given series show progressive decrease in radius with increasing atomic number. This is because the new electron enters a d orbital each time the nuclear charge increases by unity. It may be recalled that the shielding effect of a d electron is not that effective, hence the net electrostatic attraction between the nuclear charge and the outermost electron increases and the ionic radius decreases. The same trend is observed in the atomic radii of a given series. However, the variation within a series is quite small. An interesting point emerges when atomic sizes of one series are compared with those of the corresponding elements in the other series. The curves in Fig. 8.3 show an increase from the first (3d) to the second (4d) series of the elements but the radii of the third (5d) series are virtually the same as those of the corresponding members of the second series. This phenomenon is associated with the intervention of the 4f orbitals which must be filled before the 5d series of elements begin. The filling of 4f before 5d orbital results in a regular decrease in atomic radii called Lanthanoid contraction which essentially compensates for the expected increase in atomic size with increasing atomic number. The net result of the lanthanoid contraction is that the second and the third d series exhibit similar radii (e.g., Zr 160 pm, Hf 159 pm) and have very similar physical and chemical properties much more than that expected on the basis of usual family relationship.</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="images/000013.PNG" class="calibre12" /></p>

  <p class="caption"><em class="calibre9">Fig. 8.3: Trends in atomic radii of transition elements</em></p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <p class="calibre7">The factor responsible for the lanthanoid contraction is somewhat similar to that observed in an ordinary transition series and is attributed to similar cause, i.e., the imperfect shielding of one electron by another in the same set of orbitals. However, the shielding of one 4f electron by another is less than that of one d electron by another, and as the nuclear charge increases along the series, there is fairly regular decrease in the size of the entire 4f n orbitals.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The decrease in metallic radius coupled with increase in atomic mass results in a general increase in the density of these elements. Thus, from titanium (Z = 22) to copper (Z = 29) the significant increase in the density may be noted (Table 8.2).</p>

  <p class="subheading2"><strong class="calibre8">8.3.3 Ionisation Enthalpies</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre15"></p>

  <p class="calibre15">Due to an increase in nuclear charge which accompanies the filling of the inner d orbitals, there is an increase in ionisation enthalpy along each series of the transition elements from left to right. However, many small variations occur. Table 8.2 gives the values for the first three ionisation enthalpies of the first row elements. These values show that the successive enthalpies of these elements do not increase as steeply as in the main group elements. Although the first ionisation enthalpy, in general, increases, the magnitude of the increase in the second and third ionisation enthalpies for the successive elements, in general, is much higher.</p>

  <p class="calibre15"></p>

  <p class="calibre7">The irregular trend in the first ionisation enthalpy of the 3d metals, though of little chemical significance, can be accounted for by considering that the removal of one electron alters the relative energies of 4s and 3d orbitals. So the unipositive ions have dn configurations with no 4s electrons. There is thus, a reorganisation energy accompanying ionisation with some gains in exchange energy as the number of electrons increases and from the transference of s electrons into d orbitals. There is the generally expected increasing trend in the values as the effective nuclear charge increases. However, the value of Cr is lower because of the absence of any change in the d configuration and the value for Zn higher because it represents an ionisation from the 4s level. The lowest common oxidation state of these metals is +2. To form the M<sup class="calibre11">2+</sup>ions from the gaseous atoms, the sum of the first and second ionisation energies is required in addition to the enthalpy of atomisation for each element. The dominant term is the second ionisation enthalpy which shows unusually high values for Cr and Cu where the d<sup class="calibre11">5</sup> and d<sup class="calibre11">10</sup> configurations of the M<sup class="calibre11">+</sup>ions are disrupted, with considerable loss of exchange energy. The value for Zn is correspondingly low as the ionisation consists of the removal of an electron which allows the production of the stable d<sup class="calibre11">10</sup> configuration. The trend in the third ionisation enthalpies is not complicated by the 4s orbital factor and shows the greater difficulty of removing an electron from the d<sup class="calibre11">5</sup> (Mn<sup class="calibre11">2+</sup>) and d<sup class="calibre11">10</sup> (Zn<sup class="calibre11">2+</sup>) ions superimposed upon the general increasing trend. In general, the third ionisation enthalpies are quite high and there is a marked break between the values for Mn<sup class="calibre11">2+</sup> and Fe<sup class="calibre11">2+</sup>. Also the high values for copper, nickel and zinc indicate why it is difficult to obtain oxidation state greater than two for these elements.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">Although ionisation enthalpies give some guidance concerning the relative stabilities of oxidation states, this problem is very complex and not amenable to ready generalisation.</p>

  <p class="subheading2"><strong class="calibre8"><br class="calibre3" /></strong></p>

  <p class="subheading2"><strong class="calibre8">8.3.4 Oxidation States</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">One of the notable features of a transition element is the great variety of oxidation states it may show in its compounds. Table 8.3 lists the common oxidation states of the first row transition elements.</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre8"><br class="calibre3" /></strong></p>

  <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre8">Table 8.3: Oxidation States of the first row Transition Metals (the most common ones are in bold types)</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre4"></p>

  <p class="calibre4"><img alt="" heigh="192" src="images/000005.PNG" class="calibre12" /></p>

  <p class="calibre7">The elements which give the greatest number of oxidation states occur in or near the middle of the series. Manganese, for example, exhibits all the oxidation states from +2 to +7. The lesser number of oxidation states at the extreme ends stems from either too few electrons to lose or share (Sc, Ti) or too many d electrons (hence fewer orbitals available in which to share electrons with others) for higher valence (Cu, Zn). Thus, early in the series scandium(II) is virtually unknown and titanium (IV) is more stable than Ti(III) or Ti(II). At the other end, the only oxidation state of zinc is +2 (no d electrons are involved). The maximum oxidation states of reasonable stability correspond in value to the sum of the s and d electrons upto manganese (Ti<sup class="calibre11">IV</sup>O<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>, V<sup class="calibre11">V</sup>O<sup class="calibre11">2+</sup>, Cr<sup class="calibre11">VI</sup>O<sub class="calibre10">4</sub><sup class="calibre11">2&ndash;</sup>, Mn<sup class="calibre11">VII</sup>O<sub class="calibre10">4</sub><sup class="calibre11">&ndash;</sup>) followed by a rather abrupt decrease in stability of higher oxidation states, so that the typical species to follow are Fe<sup class="calibre11">II,III</sup>, Co<sup class="calibre11">II,III</sup>, Ni<sup class="calibre11">II</sup>, Cu<sup class="calibre11">I,II</sup>, Zn<sup class="calibre11">II</sup>.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The variability of oxidation states, a characteristic of transition elements, arises out of incomplete filling of d orbitals in such a way that their oxidation states differ from each other by unity, e.g., VII, VIII, VIV, VV. This is in contrast with the variability of oxidation states of non transition elements where oxidation states normally differ by a unit of two.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">An interesting feature in the variability of oxidation states of the d&ndash;block elements is noticed among the groups (groups 4 through 10). Although in the p&ndash;block the lower oxidation states are favoured by the heavier members (due to inert pair effect), the opposite is true in the groups of d-block. For example, in group 6, Mo(VI) and W(VI) are found to be more stable than Cr(VI). Thus Cr(VI) in the form of dichromate in acidic medium is a strong oxidising agent, whereas MoO<sub class="calibre10">3</sub> and WO<sub class="calibre10">3</sub> are not.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">Low oxidation states are found when a complex compound has ligands capable of π-acceptor character in addition to the σ-bonding. For example, in Ni(CO)<sub class="calibre10">4</sub> and Fe(CO)<sub class="calibre10">5</sub>, the oxidation state of nickel and iron is zero.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The unique behaviour of Cu, having a positive E, accounts for its inability to liberate H2 from acids. Only oxidising acids (nitric and hot concentrated sulphuric) react with Cu, the acids being reduced. The high energy to transform Cu(s) to Cu2+(aq) is not balanced by its hydration enthalpy. The general trend towards less negative E values across the series is related to the general increase in the sum of the first and second ionisation enthalpies. It is interesting to note that the value of E for Mn, Ni and Zn are more negative than expected from the trend.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">Table 8.5 shows the stable halides of the 3d series of transition metals. The highest oxidation numbers are achieved in TiX<sub class="calibre10">4</sub> (tetrahalides), VF<sub class="calibre10">5</sub> and CrF<sub class="calibre10">6</sub>. The +7 state for Mn is not represented in simple halides but MnO3F is known, and beyond Mn no metal has a trihalide except FeX<sub class="calibre10">3</sub> and CoF<sub class="calibre10">3</sub>. The ability of fluorine to stabilise the highest oxidation state is due to either higher lattice energy as in the case of CoF<sub class="calibre10">3</sub>, or higher bond enthalpy terms for the higher covalent compounds, e.g., VF<sub class="calibre10">5</sub> and CrF<sub class="calibre10">6</sub>.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">Although VV is represented only by VF5, the other halides, however, undergo hydrolysis to give oxohalides, VOX<sub class="calibre10">3</sub>.

  <p class="calibre7">The stability of Cu<sup class="calibre11">2+</sup> (aq) rather than Cu+(aq) is due to the much more negative ∆<sub class="calibre10">hyd</sub>H<strike class="calibre19"><sup class="calibre11">o</sup></strike> of Cu<sup class="calibre11">2+</sup> (aq) than Cu<sup class="calibre11">+</sup>, which more than compensates for the second ionisation enthalpy of Cu.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The ability of oxygen to stabilise the highest oxidation state is demonstrated in the oxides. The highest oxidation number in the oxides (Table 8.6) coincides with the group number and is attained in Sc<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">3</sub> to Mn<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">7</sub>.

  <p class="calibre15"></p>

  <p class="calibre7">Transition metals vary widely in their chemical reactivity. Many of them are sufficiently electropositive to dissolve in mineral acids, although a few are ‘noble’&mdash;that is, they are unaffected by single acids.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The metals of the first series with the exception of copper are relatively more reactive and are oxidised by 1M H<sup class="calibre11">+</sup>, though the actual rate at which these metals react with oxidising agents like hydrogen ion (H<sup class="calibre11">+</sup>) is sometimes slow. For example, titanium and vanadium, in practice, are passive to dilute non oxidising acids at room temperature. The E<strike class="calibre19"><sup class="calibre11">0</sup></strike> values for M<sup class="calibre11">2+</sup>/M (Table 8.2) indicate a decreasing tendency to form divalent cations across the series. This general trend towards less negative E<strike class="calibre19"><sup class="calibre11">0</sup></strike> values is related to the increase in the sum of the first and second ionisation enthalpies. It is interesting to note that the E<strike class="calibre19"><sup class="calibre11">0</sup></strike> values for Mn, Ni and Zn are more negative than expected from the general trend. Whereas the stabilities of half-filled d subshell (d<sup class="calibre11">5</sup>) in Mn<sup class="calibre11">2+</sup> and completely filled d subshell (d<sup class="calibre11">10</sup>) in zinc are related to their E <sup class="calibre11">e</sup> values; for nickel, E<sup class="calibre11">o</sup> value is related to the highest negative enthalpy of hydration.</p>

  <p class="subheading2"><strong class="calibre8">8.3.9 Magnetic Properties</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">When a magnetic field is applied to substances, mainly two types of magnetic behaviour are observed: diamagnetism and paramagnetism (Unit 1). Diamagnetic substances are repelled by the applied field while the paramagnetic substances are attracted. Substances which are attracted very strongly are said to be ferromagnetic. In fact, ferromagnetism is an extreme form of paramagnetism. Many of the transition metal ions are paramagnetic.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">Paramagnetism arises from the presence of unpaired electrons, each such electron having a magnetic moment associated with its spin angular momentum and orbital angular momentum. For the compounds of the first series of transition metals, the contribution of the orbital angular momentum is effectively quenched and hence is of no significance. For these, the magnetic moment is determined by the number of unpaired electrons and is calculated by using the ‘spin-only’ formula, i.e.,</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><span><img alt="4523.png" src="images/000009.png" class="calibre12" /></span></p>

  <p class="calibre7">where n is the number of unpaired electrons and µ is the magnetic moment in units of Bohr magneton (BM). A single unpaired electron has a magnetic moment of 1.73 Bohr magnetons (BM).</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The magnetic moment increases with the increasing number of unpaired electrons. Thus, the observed magnetic moment gives a useful indication about the number of unpaired electrons present in the atom, molecule or ion. The magnetic moments calculated from the ‘spin-only’ formula and those derived experimentally for some ions of the first row transition elements are given in Table 8.7. The experimental data are mainly for hydrated ions in solution or in the solid state.</p>

  <p class="subheading2"><strong class="calibre8">8.3.12 Catalytic Properties</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">The transition metals and their compounds are known for their catalytic activity. This activity is ascribed to their ability to adopt multiple oxidation states and to form complexes. Vanadium(V) oxide (in Contact Process), finely divided iron (in Haber’s Process), and nickel (in Catalytic Hydrogenation) are some of the examples. Catalysts at a solid surface involve the formation of bonds between reactant molecules and atoms of the surface of the catalyst (first row transition metals utilise 3d and 4s electrons for bonding). This has the effect of increasing the concentration of the reactants at the catalyst surface and also weakening of the bonds in the reacting molecules (the activation energy is lowering). Also because the transition metal ions can change their oxidation states, they become more effective as catalysts. For example, iron(III) catalyses the reaction between iodide and persulphate ions.</p>

Alloys may be homogeneous solid solutions in which the atoms of one metal are distributed randomly among the atoms of the other. Such alloys are formed by atoms with metallic radii that are within about 15 percent of each other. Because of similar radii and other characteristics of transition metals, alloys are readily formed by these metals. The alloys so formed are hard and have often high melting points. The best known are ferrous alloys: chromium, vanadium, tungsten, molybdenum and manganese are used for the production of a variety of steels and stainless steel. Alloys of transition metals with non transition metals such as brass (copper-zinc) and bronze (copper-tin), are also of considerable industrial importance.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">Potassium dichromate is a very important chemical used in leather industry and as an oxidant for preparation of many azo compounds. Dichromates are generally prepared from chromate, which in turn are obtained by the fusion of chromite ore (FeCr<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">4</sub>) with sodium or potassium carbonate in free access of air. The reaction with sodium carbonate occurs as follows:</p>

  <p class="calibre7">4 FeCr<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">4</sub> + 8 Na<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>CO<sub class="calibre10">3</sub> + 7 O<sub class="calibre10">2</sub> → 8 Na<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>CrO<sub class="calibre10">4</sub> + 2 Fe<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">3</sub> + 8 CO<sub class="calibre10">2</sub></p>

The chromate ion is tetrahedral whereas the dichromate ion consists of two tetrahedra sharing one corner with Cr&ndash;O&ndash;Cr bond angle of 126°. Sodium and potassium dichromates are strong oxidising agents; the sodium salt has a greater solubility in water and is extensively used as an oxidising agent in organic chemistry.

Its uses for the bleaching of wool, cotton, silk and other textile fibres and for the decolourisation of oils are also dependent on its strong oxidising power.</p>

  <p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre8">THE INNER TRANSITION ELEMENTS (f-BLOCK)</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre4"></p>

  <p class="calibre7">The f-block consists of the two series, lanthanoids (the fourteen elements following lanthanum) and actinoids (the fourteen elements following actinium). Because lanthanum closely resembles the lanthanoids, it is usually included in any discussion of the lanthanoids for which the general symbol Ln is often used. Similarly, a discussion of the actinoids includes actinium besides the fourteen elements constituting the series. The lanthanoids resemble one another more closely than do the members of ordinary transition elements in any series. They have only one stable oxidation state and their chemistry provides an excellent opportunity to examine the effect of small changes in size and nuclear charge along a series of otherwise similar elements. The chemistry of the actinoids is, on the other hand, much more complicated. The complication arises partly owing to the occurrence of a wide range of oxidation states in these elements and partly because their radioactivity creates special problems in their study; the two series will be considered separately here.</p>

  <p class="subheading"><strong class="calibre8"><br class="calibre3" /></strong></p>

  <p class="subheading"><strong class="calibre8">8.5 The Lanthanoids</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">The names, symbols, electronic configurations of atomic and some ionic states and atomic and ionic radii of lanthanum and lanthanoids (for which the general symbol Ln is used) are given in Table 8.9.</p>

  <p class="subheading2"><strong class="calibre8"><br class="calibre3" /></strong></p>

  <p class="subheading2"><strong class="calibre8">8.5.1 Electronic Configurations</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">It may be noted that atoms of these elements have electronic configuration with 6s<sup class="calibre11">2</sup> common but with variable occupancy of 4f level (Table 8.9). However, the electronic configurations of all the tripositive ions (the most stable oxidation state of all the lanthanoids) are of the form 4f <sup class="calibre11">n</sup> (n = 1 to 14 with increasing atomic number).</p>

  <p class="subheading2"><strong class="calibre8"><br class="calibre3" /></strong></p>

  <p class="subheading2"><strong class="calibre8">8.5.2 Atomic and Ionic Sizes</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">The overall decrease in atomic and ionic radii from lanthanum to lutetium (the lanthanoid contraction) is a unique feature in the chemistry of the lanthanoids. It has far reaching consequences in the chemistry of the third transition series of the elements. The decrease in atomic radii (derived from the structures of metals) is not quite regular as it is regular in M3+ ions (Fig. 8.6). This contraction is, of course, similar to that observed in an ordinary transition series and is attributed to the same cause, the imperfect shielding of one electron by another in the same sub-shell. However, the shielding of one 4 f electron by another is less than one d electron by another with the increase in nuclear charge along the series. There is fairly regular decrease in the sizes with increasing atomic number.</p>

  <p class="caption"><em class="calibre9">Fig. 8.6: Trends in ionic radii of lanthanoids</em></p>

  <p class="caption"><em class="calibre9"><br class="calibre3" /></em></p>

  <p class="calibre7">The cumulative effect of the contraction of the lanthanoid series, known as lanthanoid contraction, causes the radii of the members of the third transition series to be very similar to those of the corresponding members of the second series. The almost identical radii of Zr (160 pm) and Hf (159 pm), a consequence of the lanthanoid contraction, account for their occurrence together in nature and for the difficulty faced in their separation.</p>

  <p class="subheading2"><strong class="calibre8"><br class="calibre3" /></strong></p>

  <p class="subheading2"><strong class="calibre8">8.5.3 Oxidation States</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">In the lanthanoids, La(III) and Ln(III) compounds are predominant species. However, occasionally +2 and +4 ions in solution or in solid compounds are also obtained. This irregularity (as in ionisation enthalpies) arises mainly from the extra stability of empty, half-filled or filled f subshell. Thus, the formation of CeIV is favoured by its noble gas configuration, but it is a strong oxidant reverting to the common +3 state. The Eo value for Ce<sup class="calibre11">4+</sup>/ Ce<sup class="calibre11">3+</sup> is + 1.74 V which suggests that it can oxidise water. However, the reaction rate is very slow and hence Ce(IV) is a good analytical reagent. Pr, Nd, Tb and Dy also exhibit +4 state but only in oxides, MO<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>. Eu<sup class="calibre11">2+</sup> is formed by losing the two s electrons and its f 7 configuration accounts for the formation of this ion. However, Eu<sup class="calibre11">2+</sup> is a strong reducing agent changing to the common +3 state. Similarly Yb<sup class="calibre11">2+</sup> which has f 14 configuration is a reductant. TbIV has half-filled f-orbitals and is an oxidant. The behaviour of samarium is very much like europium, exhibiting both +2 and +3 oxidation states.</p>

  <p class="subheading2"><strong class="calibre8">8.5.4 General Characteristics</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">All the lanthanoids are silvery white soft metals and tarnish rapidly in air. The hardness increases with increasing atomic number, samarium being steel hard. Their melting points range between 1000 to 1200 K but samarium melts at 1623 K. They have typical metallic structure and are good conductors of heat and electricity. Density and other properties change smoothly except for Eu and Yb and occasionally for Sm and Tm.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">Many trivalent lanthanoid ions are coloured both in the solid state and in aqueous solutions. Colour of these ions may be attributed to the presence of f electrons. Neither La3+ nor Lu3+ ion shows any colour but the rest do so. However, absorption bands are narrow, probably because of the excitation within flevel. The lanthanoid ions other than the f <sup class="calibre11">0</sup> type (La<sup class="calibre11">3+</sup> and Ce<sup class="calibre11">4+</sup>) and the f 14 type (Yb<sup class="calibre11">2+</sup> and Lu<sup class="calibre11">3+</sup>) are all paramagnetic. The paramagnetism rises to maximum in neodymium.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The first ionisation enthalpies of the lanthanoids are around 600 kJ mol<sup class="calibre11">&ndash;1</sup>, the second about 1200 kJ mol<sup class="calibre11">&ndash;1</sup> comparable with those of calcium. A detailed discussion of the variation of the third ionisation enthalpies indicates that the exchange enthalpy considerations (as in 3d orbitals of the first transition series), appear to impart a certain degree of stability to empty, half-filled and completely filled orbitals f level. This is indicated from the abnormally low value of the third ionisation enthalpy of lanthanum, gadolinium and lutetium.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">In their chemical behaviour, in general, the earlier members of the series are quite reactive similar to calcium but, with increasing atomic number, they behave more like aluminium. Values for E for the half-reaction:</p>

  <p class="calibre7">Ln<sup class="calibre11">3+</sup>(aq) + 3e&ndash; → Ln(s)</p>

  <p class="calibre7">are in the range of &ndash;2.2 to &ndash;2.4 V except for Eu for which the value is&ndash;2.0 V. This is, of course, a small variation. The metals combine with hydrogen when gently heated in the gas. The carbides, Ln<sub class="calibre10">3</sub>C, Ln<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>C<sub class="calibre10">3</sub> and LnC<sub class="calibre10">2</sub> are formed when the metals are heated with carbon. They liberate hydrogen from dilute acids and burn in halogens to form halides. They form oxides M<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">3</sub> and hydroxides M(OH)<sub class="calibre10">3</sub>. The hydroxides are definite compounds, not just hydrated oxides. They are basic like alkaline earth metal oxides and hydroxides. Their general reactions are depicted in Fig. 8.7.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The best single use of the lanthanoids is for the production of alloy steels for plates and pipes. A well known alloy is mischmetall which consists of a lanthanoid metal (~ 95%) and iron (~ 5%) and traces of S, C, Ca and Al. A good deal of mischmetall is used in Mg-based alloy to produce bullets, shell and lighter flint. Mixed oxides of lanthanoids are employed as catalysts in petroleum cracking. Some individual Ln oxides are used as phosphors in television screens and similar fluorescing surfaces.</p>

  <p class="calibre4"></p>

  <p class="calibre7">The actinoids are radioactive elements and the earlier members have relatively long half-lives, the latter ones have half-life values ranging from a day to 3 minutes for lawrencium (Z =103). The latter members could be prepared only in nanogram quantities. These facts render their study more difficult.</p>

  <p class="subheading2"><strong class="calibre8">8.6.1 Electronic Configurations</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">All the actinoids are believed to have the electronic configuration of 7s<sup class="calibre11">2</sup> and variable occupancy of the 5f and 6d subshells. The fourteen electrons are formally added to 5f, though not in thorium (Z = 90) but from Pa onwards the 5f orbitals are complete at element 103. The irregularities in the electronic configurations of the actinoids, like those in the lanthanoids are related to the stabilities of the f <sup class="calibre11">0</sup>, f <sup class="calibre11">7</sup> and f <sup class="calibre11">14</sup> occupancies of the 5f orbitals. Thus, the configurations of Am and Cm are [Rn] 5f <sup class="calibre11">7</sup>7s<sup class="calibre11">2</sup> and [Rn] 5f <sup class="calibre11">7</sup>6d<sup class="calibre11">1</sup>7s<sup class="calibre11">2</sup>. Although the 5f orbitals resemble the 4f orbitals in their angular part of the wave-function, they are not as buried as 4f orbitals and hence 5f electrons can participate in bonding to a far greater extent.</p>

  <p class="subheading2"><strong class="calibre8"><br class="calibre3" /></strong></p>

  <p class="subheading2"><strong class="calibre8">8.6.2 Ionic Sizes</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">The general trend in lanthanoids is observable in the actinoids as well. There is a gradual decrease in the size of atoms or M<sup class="calibre11">3+</sup> ions across the series. This may be referred to as the actinoid contraction (like lanthanoid contraction). The contraction is, however, greater from element to element in this series resulting from poor shielding by 5f electrons.</p>

  <p class="subheading2"><strong class="calibre8"><br class="calibre3" /></strong></p>

  <p class="subheading2"><strong class="calibre8">8.6.3 Oxidation States</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">There is a greater range of oxidation states, which is in part attributed to the fact that the 5f, 6d and 7s levels are of comparable energies. The known oxidation states of actinoids are listed in Table 8.11.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The actinoids show in general +3 oxidation state. The elements, in the first half of the series frequently exhibit higher oxidation states. For example, the maximum oxidation state increases from +4 in Th to +5, +6 and +7 respectively in Pa, U and Np but decreases in succeeding elements (Table 8.11). The actinoids resemble the lanthanoids in having more compounds in +3 state than in the +4 state. However, +3 and +4 ions tend to hydrolyse. Because the distribution of oxidation states among the actinoids is so uneven and so different for the former and later elements, it is unsatisfactory to review their chemistry in terms of oxidation states.</p>

  <p class="subheading2"><strong class="calibre8">8.6.4 General Characteristics and Comparison with Lanthanoids</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">The actinoid metals are all silvery in appearance but display a variety of structures. The structural variability is obtained due to irregularities in metallic radii which are far greater than in lanthanoids.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The actinoids are highly reactive metals, especially when finely divided. The action of boiling water on them, for example, gives a mixture of oxide and hydride and combination with most non metals takes place at moderate temperatures. Hydrochloric acid attacks all metals but most are slightly affected by nitric acid owing to the formation of protective oxide layers; alkalies have no action.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">The magnetic properties of the actinoids are more complex than those of the lanthanoids. Although the variation in the magnetic susceptibility of the actinoids with the number of unpaired 5 f electrons is roughly parallel to the corresponding results for the lanthanoids, the latter have higher values.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">It is evident from the behaviour of the actinoids that the ionisation enthalpies of the early actinoids, though not accurately known, but are lower than for the early lanthanoids. This is quite reasonable since it is to be expected that when 5f orbitals are beginning to be occupied, they will penetrate less into the inner core of electrons. The 5f electrons, will therefore, be more effectively shielded from the nuclear charge than the 4f electrons of the corresponding lanthanoids. Because the outer electrons are less firmly held, they are available for bonding in the actinoids.</p>

  <p class="calibre7">A comparison of the actinoids with the lanthanoids, with respect to different characteristics as discussed above, reveals that behaviour similar to that of the lanthanoids is not evident until the second half of the actinoid series. However, even the early actinoids resemble the lanthanoids in showing close similarities with each other and in gradual variation in properties which do not entail change in oxidation state. The lanthanoid and actinoid contractions, have extended effects on the sizes, and therefore, the properties of the elements succeeding them in their respective periods. The lanthanoid contraction is more important because the chemistry of elements succeeding the actinoids are much less known at the present time.</p>

  <p class="subheading"><strong class="calibre8">8.7 Some Applications of d- and f-Block Elements</strong></p>

  <p class="calibre7">Iron and steels are the most important construction materials. Their production is based on the reduction of iron oxides, the removal of impurities and the addition of carbon and alloying metals such as Cr, Mn and Ni. Some compounds are manufactured for special purposes such as TiO for the pigment industry and MnO<sub class="calibre10">2</sub> for use in dry battery cells. The battery industry also requires Zn and Ni/Cd. The elements of Group 11 are still worthy of being called the coinage metals, although Ag and Au are restricted to collection items and the contemporary UK ‘copper’ coins are copper-coated steel. The ‘silver’ UK coins are a Cu/Ni alloy. Many of the metals and/or their compounds are essential catalysts in the chemical industry. V<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>O<sub class="calibre10">5</sub> catalyses the oxidation of SO<sub class="calibre10">2</sub> in the manufacture of sulphuric acid. TiCl4 with A1(CH<sub class="calibre10">3</sub>)<sub class="calibre10">3</sub> forms the basis of the Ziegler catalysts used to manufacture polyethylene (polythene). Iron catalysts are used in the Haber process for the production of ammonia from N<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>/H<sub class="calibre10">2</sub> mixtures. Nickel catalysts enable the hydrogenation of fats to proceed. In the Wacker process the oxidation of ethyne to ethanal is catalysed by PdCl<sub class="calibre10">2</sub>. Nickel complexes are useful in the polymerisation of alkynes and other organic compounds such as benzene. The photographic industry relies on the special light-sensitive properties of AgBr.</p>

  <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" /></p>

  <div class="lining_box">
    <p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">Summary</em></strong></p>

    <p class="calibre7">The d-block consisting of Groups 3-12 occupies the large middle section of the periodic table. In these elements the inner d orbitals are progressively filled. The f-block is placed outside at the bottom of the periodic table and in the elements of this block, 4f and 5f orbitals are progressively filled.</p>

    <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
    Corresponding to the filling of 3d, 4d and 5d orbitals, three series of transition elements are well recognised. All the transition elements exhibit typical metallic properties such as &ndash;high tensile strength, ductility, malleability, thermal and electrical conductivity and metallic character. Their melting and boiling points are high which are attributed to the involvement of (n&ndash;1) d electrons resulting into strong interatomic bonding. In many of these properties, the maxima occur at about the middle of each series which indicates that one unpaired electron per d orbital is particularly a favourable configuration for strong interatomic interaction.</p>

    <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
    Successive ionisation enthalpies do not increase as steeply as in the main group elements with increasing atomic number. Hence, the loss of variable number of electrons from (n &ndash;1) d orbitals is not energetically unfavourable. The involvement of (n&ndash;1) d electrons in the behaviour of transition elements impart certain distinct characteristics to these elements. Thus, in addition to variable oxidation states, they exhibit paramagnetic behaviour, catalytic properties and tendency for the formation of coloured ions, interstitial compounds and complexes.</p>

    <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
    The transition elements vary widely in their chemical behaviour. Many of them are sufficiently electropositive to dissolve in mineral acids, although a few are 'noble'. Of the first series, with the exception of copper, all the metals are relatively reactive.</p>

    <p class="calibre7">The transition metals react with a number of non-metals like oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur and halogens to form binary compounds. The first series transition metal oxides<br class="calibre3" />
    are generally formed from the reaction of metals with oxygen at high temperatures. These oxides dissolve in acids and bases to form oxometallic salts. Potassium dichromate and potassium permanganate are common examples. Potassium dichromate is prepared from the chromite ore by fusion with alkali in presence of air and acidifying the extract. Pyrolusite ore (MnO2) is used for the preparation of potassium permanganate. Both the dichromate and the permanganate ions are strong oxidising agents.</p>

    <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
    The two series of inner transition elements, lanthanoids and actinoids constitute the f-block of the periodic table. With the successive filling of the inner orbitals, 4f, there is a gradual decrease in the atomic and ionic sizes of these metals along the series (lanthanoid contraction). This has far reaching consequences in the chemistry of the elements succeeding them. Lanthanum and all the lanthanoids are rather soft white metals. They react easily with water to give solutions giving +3 ions. The principal oxidation state is +3, although +4 and +2 oxidation states are also exhibited by some occasionally. The chemistry of the actinoids is more complex in view of their ability to exist in different oxidation states. Furthermore, many of the actinoid elements are radioactive which make the study of these elements rather difficult.</p>

    <p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
    There are many useful applications of the d- and f-block elements and their compounds, notable among them being in varieties of steels, catalysts, complexes,<br class="calibre3" />
    organic syntheses, etc.</p>
