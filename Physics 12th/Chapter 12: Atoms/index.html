    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">By the nineteenth century, enough evidence had accumulated in favour of atomic hypothesis of matter. In 1897, the experiments on electric discharge through gases carried out by the English physicist J</span><span class="char-style-override">. J. Thomson (1856 &ndash; 1940) revealed that atoms of different elements contain negatively charged constituents (electrons) that are identical for all atoms. However, atoms on a whole are electrically neutral. Therefore, an atom must also contain some positive charge to neutralise the negative charge of the electrons. But what is the arrangement of the positive charge and the electrons inside the atom? In other words, what is the structure of an atom?</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">The first model of atom was proposed by J. J. Thomson in 1898. According to this model, the positive charge of the atom is uniformly distributed throughout the volume of the atom and the negatively charged electrons are embedded in it like seeds in a watermelon. This model was picturesquely called</span> <span class="char-style-override1">plum pudding model</span> <span class="char-style-override">of the atom. However subsequent studies on atoms, as described in this chapter, showed that the distribution of the electrons and positive charges are very different from that proposed in this model.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">We know that condensed matter (solids and liquids) and dense gases at all temperatures emit electromagnetic radiation in which a continuous distribution of several wavelengths is present, though with different intensities. This radiation is considered to be due to oscillations of atoms</span> <span class="char-style-override">and molecules, governed by the interaction of each atom or molecule with its neighbours.</span> <span class="char-style-override1">In contrast</span><span class="char-style-override">, light emitted from rarefied gases heated in a flame, or excited electrically in a glow tube such as the familiar neon sign or mercury vapour light has only certain discrete wavelengths. The spectrum appears as a series of bright lines. In such gases, the average spacing between atoms is large. Hence, the radiation emitted can be considered due to individual atoms rather than because of interactions between atoms or molecules.</span></p>

He discovered alpha-rays and beta-rays. Along with Federick Soddy, he created the modern theory of radioactivity. He studied the ‘emanation’ of thorium and discovered a new noble gas, an isotope of radon, now known as thoron. By scattering alpha-rays from the metal foils, he discovered the atomic nucleus and proposed the plenatery model of the atom. He also estimated the approximate size of the nucleus.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">In the early nineteenth century it was also established that each element is associated with a characteristic spectrum of radiation, for example, hydrogen always gives a set of lines with fixed relative position between the lines. This fact suggested an intimate relationship between the internal structure of an atom and the spectrum of radiation emitted by it. In 1885, Johann Jakob Balmer (1825 &ndash; 1898) obtained a simple empirical formula which gave the wavelengths of a group of lines emitted by atomic hydrogen. Since hydrogen is simplest of the elements known, we shall consider its spectrum in detail in this chapter.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">Ernst Rutherford (1871&ndash;1937), a former research student of J. J. Thomson, was engaged in experiments on</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particles emitted by some radioactive elements. In 1906, he proposed a classic experiment of scattering of these</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particles by atoms to investigate the atomic structure. This experiment was later performed around 1911 by Hans Geiger (1882&ndash;1945) and Ernst Marsden (1889&ndash;1970, who was 20 year-old student and had not yet earned his bachelor’s degree). The details are discussed in Section 12.2. The explanation of the results led to the birth of Rutherford’s planetary model of atom (also called the</span> <span class="char-style-override1">nuclear model of the ato</span><span class="char-style-override1">m</span><span class="char-style-override">). According to this the entire positive charge and most of the mass of the atom is concentrated in a small volume called the nucleus with electrons revolving around the nucleus just as planets revolve around the sun.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">Rutherford’s nuclear model was a major step towards how we see the atom today. However, it could not explain why atoms emit light of only discrete wavelengths. How could an atom as simple as hydrogen, consisting of a single electron and a single proton, emit a complex spectrum of specific wavelengths? In the classical picture of an atom, the electron revolves round the nucleus much like the way a planet revolves round the sun. However, we shall see that there are some serious difficulties in accepting such a model.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">At the suggestion of Ernst Rutherford, in 1911, H. Geiger and E. Marsden performed some experiments. In one of their experiments, as shown in Fig. 12.1, they directed a beam of<br class="calibre4" />

The scattered alpha-particles were observed through a rotatable detector consisting of zinc sulphide screen and a microscope. The scattered alpha-particles on striking the screen produced brief light flashes or scintillations.

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">A typical graph of the total number of</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particles scattered at different angles, in a given interval of time, is shown in Fig. 12.3. The dots in this figure represent the data points and the solid curve is the theoretical prediction based on the assumption that the target atom has a small, dense, positively charged nucleus. Many of the</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particles pass through the foil. It means that they do not suffer any collisions. Only about 0.14% of the incident</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particles scatter by more than 1º; and about 1 in 8000 deflect by more than 90º. Rutherford argued that, to deflect the</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particle backwards, it must experience a large repulsive force. This force could</span> <span class="char-style-override">be provided if the greater part of the mass of the atom and its positive charge were concentrated tightly at its centre. Then the incoming</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particle could get very close to the positive charge without penetrating it, and such a close encounter would result in a large deflection. This agreement supported the hypothesis of the nuclear atom. This is why Rutherford is credited with the</span> <span class="char-style-override1">discovery</span> <span class="char-style-override">of the nucleus.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">In Rutherford’s nuclear model of the atom, the entire positive charge and most of the mass of the atom are concentrated in the nucleus with the electrons some distance away. The electrons would be moving in orbits about the nucleus just as the planets do around the sun. Rutherford’s experiments suggested the size of&nbsp;the nucleus to be about 10</span><span class="char-style-override2"><sup class="calibre8">&ndash;15</sup></span> <span class="char-style-override">m to&nbsp;10</span><span class="char-style-override2"><sup class="calibre8">&ndash;14</sup></span> <span class="char-style-override">m. From kinetic theory, the size of an atom was known to be 10</span><span class="char-style-override2"><sup class="calibre8">&ndash;10</sup></span> <span class="char-style-override">m, about 10,000 to 100,000 times larger than the size of the nucleus (see Chapter 11, Section 11.6 in Class XI Physics textbook). Thus, the electrons would seem to be at a distance from the nucleus of about 10,000 to 100,000 times the size of the nucleus itself. Thus, most of an atom is empty space. With the atom being largely empty space, it is easy to see why most</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particles go right through a thin metal foil. However, when</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particle happens to come near a nucleus, the intense electric field there scatters it through a large angle. The atomic electrons, being so light, do not appreciably affect the</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particles.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">The scattering data shown in Fig. 12.3 can be analysed by employing Rutherford’s nuclear model of the atom. As the gold foil is very thin, it can be assumed that</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particles will suffer not more than one scattering during their passage through it. Therefore, computation of the trajectory of an alpha-particle scattered by a single nucleus is enough. Alpha-particles are nuclei of helium atoms and, therefore, carry two units, 2</span><span class="char-style-override1">e</span><span class="char-style-override">, of positive charge and have the mass of the helium atom. The charge of the gold nucleus is Z</span><span class="char-style-override1">e</span><span class="char-style-override">, where</span> <span class="char-style-override1">Z</span> <span class="char-style-override">is the atomic number of the atom; for gold</span> <span class="char-style-override1">Z</span> <span class="char-style-override">= 79. Since the nucleus of gold is about 50 times heavier than an</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particle, it is reasonable to assume that it remains stationary throughout the scattering process. Under these assumptions, the trajectory of an alpha-particle can be computed employing Newton’s second law of motion and the Coulomb’s law for electrostatic&nbsp;force of repulsion between the alpha-particle and the positively&nbsp;charged nucleus.</span></p>

    <p class="subheading">12.2.1 Alpha-particle trajectory</p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override"><br class="calibre4" />
    The trajectory traced by an</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particle depends on the impact parameter,</span> <span class="char-style-override1">b</span> <span class="char-style-override">of collision. The</span> <span class="char-style-override1">impact parameter</span> <span class="char-style-override">is the perpendicular distance of the initial velocity vector of the</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particle from the centre of the nucleus (Fig. 12.4). A given beam of</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particles has a distribution of impact parameters</span> <span class="char-style-override1">b</span><span class="char-style-override">, so that the beam is scattered in various directions with different probabilities (Fig. 12.4). (In a beam, all particles have nearly same kinetic energy.) It is seen that an</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particle close to the nucleus (small impact parameter) suffers large scattering. In case of head-on collision, the impact parameter is minimum and the</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particle rebounds back (</span><span class="char-style-override">θ ≅ π</span><span class="char-style-override">). For a large impact parameter, the</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particle goes nearly undeviated and has a small deflection (</span><span class="char-style-override">θ ≅</span> <span class="char-style-override">0).</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">The fact that only a small fraction of the number of incident particles rebound back indicates that the number of</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particles undergoing head on collision is small. This, in turn, implies that the mass of the atom is concentrated in a small volume. Rutherford scattering therefore, is a powerful way to determine an upper limit to the size of the nucleus.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">As mentioned in Section 12.1, each element has a characteristic spectrum of radiation, which it emits. When an atomic gas or vapour is excited at low pressure, usually by passing an electric current through it, the emitted radiation has a spectrum which contains certain specific wavelengths only. A spectrum of this kind is termed as emission line spectrum and it consists of bright lines on a dark background. The spectrum emitted by atomic hydrogen is shown in Fig.&nbsp;12.5. Study of emission line spectra of a material can therefore serve as a type of “fingerprint” for identification of the gas. When white light passes through a gas and we analyse the transmitted light using a spectrometer we find some dark lines in the spectrum. These dark lines correspond precisely to those wavelengths which were found in the emission line spectrum of the gas. This is called the</span> <span class="char-style-override1">absorption spectrum</span> <span class="char-style-override">of the material of the gas.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">The model of the atom proposed by Rutherford assumes that the atom, consisting of a central nucleus and revolving electron is stable much like sun-planet system which the model imitates. However, there are some fundamental differences between the two situations. While the planetary system is held by gravitational force, the nucleus-electron system being charged objects, interact by Coulomb’s Law of force. We know that an object which moves in a circle is being constantly accelerated &ndash; the acceleration being centripetal in nature. According to classical electromagnetic theory, an accelerating charged particle emits radiation in the form of electromagnetic waves. The energy of an accelerating electron should therefore, continuously decrease. The electron would spiral inward and eventually fall into the nucleus (Fig. 12.7). Thus, such an atom can not be stable. Further, according to the classical electromagnetic theory, the frequency of the electromagnetic waves emitted by the revolving electrons is equal to the frequency of revolution. As the electrons spiral inwards, their angular velocities and hence their frequencies would change continuously, and so will the frequency of the light emitted. Thus, they would emit a continuous spectrum, in contradiction to the line spectrum actually observed. Clearly Rutherford model tells only a part of the story implying that the classical ideas are not sufficient to explain the atomic structure.</span>&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">It was Niels Bohr (1885 &ndash; 1962) who made certain modifications in this model by adding the ideas of the newly developing quantum hypothesis. Niels Bohr studied in Rutherford’s laboratory for several months in 1912 and he was convinced about the validity of Rutherford nuclear model. Faced with the dilemma as discussed above, Bohr, in 1913, concluded that in spite of the success of electromagnetic theory in explaining large-scale phenomena, it could not be applied to the processes at the atomic scale. It became clear that a fairly radical departure from the established principles of classical mechanics and electromagnetism would be needed to understand the structure of atoms and the relation of atomic structure to atomic spectra. Bohr combined classical and early quantum concepts and gave his theory in the form of three postulates. These are :</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">(i) Bohr’s first postulate was that</span> <span class="char-style-override1">an electron in an atom could revolve in certain stable orbits without the emission of radiant energy</span><span class="char-style-override">, contrary to the predictions of electromagnetic theory. According to this postulate, each atom has certain definite stable states in which it can exist, and each possible state has definite total energy. These are called the stationary states of the atom.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">(ii) Bohr’s second postulate defines these stable orbits. This postulate states that the</span> <span class="char-style-override1">electron</span> <span class="char-style-override">revolves around the nucleus</span> <span class="char-style-override1">only in those orbits for which the angular momentum is some integral multiple of h/</span><span class="char-style-override">2</span><span class="char-style-override">π</span> <span class="char-style-override">where</span> <span class="char-style-override1">h</span> <span class="char-style-override">is the Planck’s constant (= 6.6</span> <span class="char-style-override">×</span> <span class="char-style-override">10</span><span class="char-style-override2"><sup class="calibre8">&ndash;34</sup></span> <span class="char-style-override">J s).

      <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">We are introduced to the Bohr Model of atom one time or the other in the course of physics. This model has its place in the history of quantum mechanics and particularly in explaining the structure of an atom. It has become a milestone since Bohr introduced the revolutionary idea of definite energy orbits for the electrons, contrary to the classical picture requiring an accelerating particle to radiate. Bohr also introduced the idea of quantisation of angular momentum of electrons moving in definite orbits. Thus it was a semi-classical picture of the structure of atom.</span></p>

      <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">Now with the development of quantum mechanics, we have a better understanding of the structure of atom. Solutions of the Schrödinger wave equation assign a wave-like description to the electrons bound in an atom due to attractive forces of the protons.</span></p>

      <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">An orbit of the electron in the Bohr model is the circular path of motion of an electron around the nucleus. But according to quantum mechanics, we cannot associate a definite path with the motion of the electrons in an atom. We can only talk about the probability of finding an electron in a certain region of space around the nucleus. This probability can be inferred from the one-electron wave function called the</span> <span class="char-style-override1">orbital</span><span class="char-style-override">. This function depends only on the coordinates of the electron.</span></p>

      <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">It is therefore essential that we understand the subtle differences that exist in the two models:</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">At room temperature, most of the hydrogen atoms are in</span> <span class="char-style-override1">ground state</span><span class="char-style-override">. When a hydrogen atom receives energy by processes such as electron collisions, the atom may acquire sufficient energy to raise the electron to higher energy states. The atom is then said to be in an</span> <span class="char-style-override1">excited state</span><span class="char-style-override">. From Eq. (12.19), for</span> <span class="char-style-override1">n</span> <span class="char-style-override">= 2; the energy</span> <span class="char-style-override1">E</span><span class="char-style-override5">2</span> <span class="char-style-override">is&nbsp;&ndash;3.40 eV. It means that the energy required to excite an electron in hydrogen atom to its first excited state, is an energy equal to</span> <span class="char-style-override1">E</span><span class="char-style-override5">2</span> <span class="char-style-override1">&ndash; E</span><span class="char-style-override5">1</span> <span class="char-style-override">= &ndash;3.40 eV &ndash; (&ndash;13.6) eV = 10.2 eV.

From these excited states the electron can then fall back to a state of lower energy, emitting a photon in the process. Thus, as the excitation of hydrogen atom increases (that is as</span> <span class="char-style-override1">n</span> <span class="char-style-override">increases) the value of minimum energy required to free the electron from the excited atom decreases.</span></p>

      <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">The existence of discrete energy levels in an atom was directly verified in 1914 by James Franck and Gustav Hertz. They studied the spectrum of mercury vapour when electrons having different kinetic energies passed through the vapour. The electron energy was varied by subjecting the electrons to electric fields of varying strength. The electrons collide with the mercury atoms and can transfer energy to the mercury atoms. This can only happen when the energy of the electron is higher than the energy difference between an energy level of Hg occupied by an electron and a higher unoccupied level (see Figure). For instance, the difference between an occupied energy level of Hg and a higher unoccupied level is 4.9 eV. If an electron of having an energy of 4.9 eV or more passes through mercury, an electron in mercury atom can absorb energy from the bombarding electron and get excited to the higher level [Fig (a)]. The colliding electron’s kinetic energy would reduce by this amount.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">The various lines in the atomic spectra are produced when electrons jump from higher energy state to a lower energy state and photons are emitted. These spectral lines are called emission lines. But when an atom absorbs a photon that has precisely</span> <span class="char-style-override">the same energy needed by the electron in a lower energy state to make transitions to a higher energy state, the process is called absorption. Thus if photons with a continuous range of frequencies pass through a rarefied gas and then are analysed with a spectrometer, a series of dark spectral absorption lines appear in the continuous spectrum. The dark lines indicate the frequencies that have been absorbed by the atoms of the gas.</span></p>

    </div>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">Of all the postulates, Bohr made in his model of the atom, perhaps the most puzzling is his second postulate. It states that the angular momentum of the electron orbiting around the nucleus is quantised (that is,</span> <span class="char-style-override1">L</span><span class="char-style-override1"><sub class="calibre12">n</sub></span> <span class="char-style-override1">= nh/2</span><span class="char-style-override">π</span><span class="char-style-override">;</span> <span class="char-style-override1">n</span> <span class="char-style-override">= 1, 2, 3 …). Why should the angular momentum have only those values that are integral multiples of</span> <span class="char-style-override1">h/2</span><span class="char-style-override">π</span><span class="char-style-override">? The French physicist Louis de Broglie explained this puzzle in 1923, ten years after Bohr proposed his model.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">We studied, in Chapter 11, about the de Broglie’s hypothesis that material particles, such as electrons, also have a wave nature. C. J. Davisson and</span> <span class="char-style-override">L. H. Germer later experimentally verified the wave nature of electrons</span> <span class="char-style-override">in 1927. Louis de Broglie argued that the electron in its circular orbit, as proposed by Bohr, must be seen as a particle wave. In analogy to waves travelling on a string, particle waves too can lead to standing waves under resonant conditions. From Chapter 15 of Class XI Physics textbook, we know that when a string is plucked, a vast number of wavelengths are excited. However only those wavelengths survive which have nodes at the ends and form the standing wave in the string. It means that in a string, standing waves are formed when the total distance travelled by a wave down the string and back is one wavelength, two wavelengths, or any integral number of wavelengths. Waves with other wavelengths interfere with themselves upon reflection and their amplitudes quickly drop to zero.

In the case of laser light, the wavelength of each packet is almost the same. Also the average length of the packet of waves is much larger.

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override5">7. To explain the line spectra emitted by atoms, as well as the stability of atoms, Niel’s Bohr proposed a model for hydrogenic (single elctron) atoms. He introduced three postulates and laid the foundations of quantum mechanics:</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override5">(a) In a hydrogen atom, an electron revolves in certain stable orbits (called stationary orbits) without the emission of radiant energy.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override5">(b) The stationary orbits are those for which the angular momentum is some integral multiple of</span> <span class="char-style-override">h</span><span class="char-style-override7">/2</span><span class="char-style-override">π</span><span class="char-style-override5">. (Bohr’s quantisation condition.) That is</span> <span class="char-style-override">L = nh</span><span class="char-style-override7">/2</span><span class="char-style-override">π</span><span class="char-style-override5">, where</span> <span class="char-style-override">n</span> <span class="char-style-override5">is an integer called a quantum number.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override5">(c) The third postulate states that an electron might make a transition from one of its specified non-radiating orbits to another of lower energy. When it does so, a photon is emitted having energy equal to the energy difference between the initial and final states. The frequency (</span><span class="char-style-override">ν)</span> <span class="char-style-override5">of the emitted photon is then given by</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">h</span><span class="char-style-override">ν</span> <span class="char-style-override5">=</span> <span class="char-style-override">E</span><span class="char-style-override"><sub class="calibre9">i</sub></span> <span class="char-style-override">&ndash; E</span><span class="char-style-override"><sub class="calibre9">f</sub></span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override5">An atom absorbs radiation of the same frequency the atom emits, in which case the electron is transferred to an orbit with a higher value of</span> <span class="char-style-override">n</span><span class="char-style-override5">.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override5">1. Both the Thomson’s as well as the Rutherford’s models constitute an unstable system. Thomson’s model is unstable electrostatically, while Rutherford’s model is unstable because of electromagnetic radiation of orbiting electrons.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override5">2. What made Bohr quantise angular momentum (second postulate) and not some other quantity? Note,</span> <span class="char-style-override">h</span> <span class="char-style-override5">has dimensions of angular momentum, and for circular orbits, angular momentum is a very relevant quantity. The second postulate is then so natural!</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override5">3. The orbital picture in Bohr’s model of the hydrogen atom was inconsistent with the uncertainty principle. It was replaced by modern quantum mechanics in which Bohr’s orbits are regions where the electron may be found with large probability.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override5">4. Unlike the situation in the solar system, where planet-planet gravitational forces are very small as compared to the gravitational force of the sun on each planet (because the mass of the sun is so much greater than the mass of any of the planets), the electron-electron electric force interaction is comparable in magnitude to the electron-nucleus electrical force, because the charges and distances are of the same order of magnitude. This is the reason why the Bohr’s model with its planet-like electron is not applicable to many electron atoms.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override5">5. Bohr laid the foundation of the quantum theory by postulating specific orbits in which electrons do not radiate. Bohr’s model include only one quantum number</span> <span class="char-style-override">n</span><span class="char-style-override5">. The new theory called quantum mechanics supportes Bohr’s postulate. However in quantum mechanics (more generally accepted), a given energy level may not correspond to just one quantum state. For example, a state is characterised by four quantum numbers (</span><span class="char-style-override">n</span><span class="char-style-override5">,</span> <span class="char-style-override">l</span><span class="char-style-override5">,</span> <span class="char-style-override">m</span><span class="char-style-override5">, and</span> <span class="char-style-override">s</span><span class="char-style-override5">), but for a pure Coulomb potential (as in hydrogen atom) the energy depends only on</span> <span class="char-style-override">n</span><span class="char-style-override5">.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override5">6. In Bohr model, contrary to ordinary classical expectation, the frequency of revolution of an electron in its orbit is not connected to the frequency of spectral line. The later is the difference between two orbital energies divided by</span> <span class="char-style-override">h</span><span class="char-style-override5">. For transitions between large quantum numbers (</span><span class="char-style-override">n</span> <span class="char-style-override5">to</span> <span class="char-style-override">n</span> <span class="char-style-override5">&ndash; 1,</span> <span class="char-style-override">n</span> <span class="char-style-override5">very large), however, the two coincide as expected.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override5">7. Bohr’s semiclassical model based on some aspects of classical physics and some aspects of modern physics also does not provide a true picture of the simplest hydrogenic atoms. The true picture is quantum mechanical affair which differs from Bohr model in a number of fundamental ways. But then if the Bohr model is not strictly correct, why do we bother about it? The reasons which make Bohr’s model still useful are:</span></p>

    <p class="footer"><span class="char-style-override5">(i) The model is based on just three postulates but accounts for almost all the general features of the hydrogen spectrum.</span></p>

    <p class="footer"><span class="char-style-override5">(ii) The model incorporates many of the concepts we have learnt in classical physics.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override5">(iii) The model demonstrates how a theoretical physicist occasionally must quite literally ignore certain problems of approach in hopes of being able to make some predictions. If the predictions of the theory or model agree with experiment, a theoretician then must somehow hope to explain away or rationalise the problems that were ignored along the way.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">12.11</span> <span class="char-style-override">Answer the following questions, which help you understand the difference between Thomson’s model and Rutherford’s model better.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">(a) Is the average angle of deflection of</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particles by a thin gold foil predicted by Thomson’s model much less, about the same, or much greater than that predicted by Rutherford’s model?</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">(b) Is the probability of backward scattering (i.e., scattering of</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particles at angles greater than 90°) predicted by Thomson’s model much less, about the same, or much greater than that predicted by Rutherford’s mode</span><span class="char-style-override">l</span><span class="char-style-override">?</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">(c) Keeping other factors fixed, it is found experimentally that for small thickness</span> <span class="char-style-override5">t</span><span class="char-style-override">, the number of</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particles scattered at moderate angles is proportional to</span> <span class="char-style-override5">t</span><span class="char-style-override">. What clue does this linear dependence on</span> <span class="char-style-override5">t</span> <span class="char-style-override">provide?</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">(d) In which model is it completely wrong to ignore multiple scattering for the calculation of average angle of scattering of</span> <span class="char-style-override"><br class="calibre4" />
    α</span><span class="char-style-override">-particles by a thin foil?</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">12.12</span> <span class="char-style-override">The gravitational attraction between electron and proton in a hydrogen atom is weaker than the coulomb attraction by a factor of about 10</span><span class="char-style-override6"><sup class="calibre11">&ndash;40</sup></span><span class="char-style-override">. An alternative way of looking at this fact is to estimate the radius of the first Bohr orbit of a hydrogen atom if the electron and proton were bound by gravitational attraction. You will find the answer interesting.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">12.13</span> <span class="char-style-override">Obtain an expression for the frequency of radiation emitted when a hydrogen atom de-excites from level</span> <span class="char-style-override5">n</span> <span class="char-style-override">to level (</span><span class="char-style-override7">n</span><span class="char-style-override">&ndash;1). For large</span> <span class="char-style-override5">n</span><span class="char-style-override">, show that this frequency equals the classical frequency of revolution of the electron in the orbit.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">12.14</span> <span class="char-style-override">Classically, an electron can be in any orbit around the nucleus of an atom. Then what determines the typical atomic size? Why is an atom not, say, thousand times bigger than its typical size? The question had greatly puzzled Bohr before he arrived at his famous model of the atom that you have learnt in the text. To simulate what he might well have done before his discovery, let us play as follows with the basic constants of nature and see if we can get a quantity with the dimensions of length that is roughly equal to the known size of an atom (~ 10</span><span class="char-style-override6"><sup class="calibre11">&ndash;10</sup></span><span class="char-style-override">m).</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">(a) Construct a quantity with the dimensions of length from the fundamental constants</span> <span class="char-style-override7">e</span><span class="char-style-override">,</span> <span class="char-style-override7">m</span><span class="char-style-override">e</span><span class="char-style-override">, and</span> <span class="char-style-override7">c</span><span class="char-style-override">. Determine its numerical value.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">(b) You will find that the length obtained in (a) is many orders of magnitude smaller than the atomic dimensions. Further, it involves</span> <span class="char-style-override5">c</span><span class="char-style-override">. But energies of atoms are mostly in non-relativistic domain where</span> <span class="char-style-override5">c</span> <span class="char-style-override">is not expected to play any role. This is what may have suggested Bohr to discard</span> <span class="char-style-override5">c</span> <span class="char-style-override">and look for ‘something else’ to get the right atomic size. Now, the Planck’s constant</span> <span class="char-style-override5">h</span> <span class="char-style-override">had already made its appearance elsewhere. Bohr’s great insight lay in recognising that</span> <span class="char-style-override5">h</span><span class="char-style-override">,</span> <span class="char-style-override5">m</span><span class="char-style-override">e</span><span class="char-style-override">, and</span> <span class="char-style-override5">e</span> <span class="char-style-override">will yield the right atomic size. Construct a quantity with the dimension of length from</span> <span class="char-style-override5">h</span><span class="char-style-override">,</span> <span class="char-style-override5">m</span><span class="char-style-override">e, and</span> <span class="char-style-override5">e</span> <span class="char-style-override">and confirm that its numerical value has indeed the correct order of magnitude.</span></p>
