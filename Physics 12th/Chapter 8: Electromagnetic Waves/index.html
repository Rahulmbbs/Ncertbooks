    <p class="heading">8.1 INTRODUCTION</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">In Chapter 4, we learnt that an electric current produces magnetic field and that two current-carrying wires exert a magnetic force on each other. Further, in Chapter 6, we have seen that a magnetic field changing with time gives rise to an electric field. Is the converse also true? Does an electric field changing with time give rise to a magnetic field? James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879), argued that this was indeed the case &ndash; not only an electric current but also a time-varying electric field generates magnetic field. While applying the Ampere’s circuital law to find magnetic field at a point outside a capacitor connected to a time-varying current, Maxwell noticed an inconsistency in the Ampere’s circuital law. He suggested the existence of an additional current, called by him, the displacement current to remove this inconsistency.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Maxwell formulated a set of equations involving electric and magnetic fields, and their sources, the charge and current densities. These equations are known as Maxwell’s equations. Together with the Lorentz force formula (Chapter 4), they mathematically express all the basic laws of electromagnetism.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The most important prediction to emerge from Maxwell’s equations is the existence of electromagnetic waves, which are (coupled) time-varying electric and magnetic fields that propagate in space. The speed of the waves, according to these equations, turned out to be very close to</span> <span class="char-style-override">the speed of light( 3 ×10</span><sup class="calibre7">8</sup> <span class="char-style-override">m/s), obtained from optical measurements. This led to the remarkable conclusion that light is an electromagnetic wave. Maxwell’s work thus unified the domain of electricity, magnetism and light. Hertz, in 1885, experimentally demonstrated the existence of electromagnetic waves. Its technological use by Marconi and others led in due course to the revolution in communication that we are witnessing today.</span></p>

From these he arrived at the most important conclusion that light is an electromagnetic wave. Interestingly, Maxwell did not agree with the idea (strongly suggested by the Faraday’s laws of electrolysis) that electricity was particulate in nature.</span></p>

    <p class="heading">8.2 DISPLACEMENT CURRENT</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">We have seen in Chapter 4 that an electrical current produces a magnetic field around it. Maxwell showed that for logical consistency, a changing electric field</span> <span class="char-style-override">must also</span> <span class="char-style-override">produce a magnetic field. This effect is of great importance because it explains the existence of radio waves, gamma rays and visible light, as well as all other forms of electromagnetic waves.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">To see how a changing electric field gives rise to&nbsp;a magnetic field, let us consider the process of&nbsp;charging of a capacitor and apply Ampere’s circuital law given by (Chapter 4)</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override"></span><span class="char-style-override">B</span><span class="char-style-override">.</span><span class="char-style-override">d</span><span class="char-style-override">l =</span> <span class="char-style-override">µ</span><sub class="calibre9">0</sub> <span class="char-style-override">i</span> <span class="char-style-override">(</span><span class="char-style-override">t</span><span class="char-style-override">) (8.1)</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">to find magnetic field at a point outside the capacitor.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Figure 8.1(a) shows a parallel plate capacitor</span> <span class="char-style-override">C</span> <span class="char-style-override">which is a part of circuit through which a time-dependent current</span> <span class="char-style-override">i</span> <span class="char-style-override">(</span><span class="char-style-override">t</span><span class="char-style-override">) flows . Let us find the magnetic field at a point such as P, in a region outside the parallel plate capacitor. For this, we consider a plane circular loop of radius</span> <span class="char-style-override">r</span> <span class="char-style-override">whose plane is perpendicular to the direction of the current-carrying wire, and which is centred symmetrically with respect to the wire [Fig. 8.1(a)]. From symmetry, the magnetic field is directed along the circumference of the circular loop and is the same in magnitude at all points on the loop so that if</span> <span class="char-style-override">B</span> <span class="char-style-override">is the magnitude of the field, the left side of Eq. (8.1) is</span> <span class="char-style-override">B</span> <span class="char-style-override">(2</span><span class="char-style-override">π</span> <span class="char-style-override">r</span><span class="char-style-override">). So we have</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">B</span> <span class="char-style-override">(2</span><span class="char-style-override">π</span><span class="char-style-override">r)</span> <span class="char-style-override">=</span> <span class="char-style-override">µ</span><sub class="calibre9">0</sub><span class="char-style-override">i</span> <span class="char-style-override">(</span><span class="char-style-override">t</span><span class="char-style-override">) (8 .2)</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Now, consider a different surface, which has the same boundary. This is a pot like surface [Fig. 8.1(b)] which nowhere touches the current, but has its bottom between the capacitor plates; its mouth is the circular loop mentioned above. Another such surface is shaped like a tiffin box (without the lid) [Fig. 8.1(c)]. On applying Ampere’s circuital law to such surfaces with the</span> <span class="char-style-override">same</span> <span class="char-style-override">perimeter, we find that the left hand side of&nbsp;Eq. (8.1) has not changed but the right hand side is</span> <span class="char-style-override">zero</span> <span class="char-style-override">and</span> <span class="char-style-override">not</span> <span class="char-style-override">µ</span><sub class="calibre9">0</sub><span class="char-style-override">i,</span> <span class="char-style-override">since</span> <span class="char-style-override">no</span> <span class="char-style-override">current passes through the surface of Fig. 8.1(b) and (c). So we have a</span> <span class="char-style-override">contradiction</span><span class="char-style-override">; calculated one way, there is a magnetic field at a point P; calculated another way, the magnetic field at P is zero.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Since the contradiction arises from our use of Ampere’s circuital law, this law must be missing something. The missing term must be such that one gets the same magnetic field at point P, no matter what surface is used.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override"><span class="char-style-override">We can actually guess the missing term by looking carefully at&nbsp;Fig. 8.1(c). Is there anything passing through the surface S</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">between</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">the plates of the capacitor? Yes, of course, the electric field! If the plates of the capacitor have an area</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">A</span><span class="char-style-override">, and a total charge</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">Q</span><span class="char-style-override">, the magnitude of the electric field</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">E</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">between the plates is (</span><span class="char-style-override">Q/A</span><span class="char-style-override">)/</span><span class="char-style-override">ε</span><sub class="calibre9">0</sub>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">(see Eq. 2.41). The field is perpendicular to the surface</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">S</span><span class="char-style-override">of Fig. 8.1(c). It has the same magnitude over the area</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">A</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">of the capacitor plates, and vanishes outside it. So what is the</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">electric</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">flux</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">Φ</span><sub class="calibre9">E</sub>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">through the surface</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">S</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">?

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">This is the missing term in Ampere’s circuital law.

The current carried by conductors due to flow of charges is called</span> <span class="char-style-override">conduction current</span><span class="char-style-override">. The current, given by Eq. (8.4), is a new term, and is due to changing electric field (or electric</span> <span class="char-style-override">displacement,</span> <span class="char-style-override">an old term still used sometimes). It is, therefore, called</span> <span class="char-style-override">displacement current</span> <span class="char-style-override">or Maxwell’s displacement current. Figure 8.2 shows the electric and magnetic fields inside the parallel plate capacitor discussed above.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The generalisation made by Maxwell then is the following.

More precisely, the total current</span> <span class="char-style-override">i</span> <span class="char-style-override">is the sum of the conduction current denoted by</span> <span class="char-style-override">i</span><sub class="calibre9">c</sub><span class="char-style-override">,</span> <span class="char-style-override">and the displacement current denoted by</span> <span class="char-style-override">i</span><sub class="calibre9">d</sub> <span class="char-style-override">(=</span> <span class="char-style-override">ε</span><sub class="calibre9">0</sub> <span class="char-style-override">(d</span><span class="char-style-override">Φ</span><sub class="calibre9">E</sub><span class="char-style-override">/d</span><span class="char-style-override">t</span><span class="char-style-override">)).

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">In explicit terms, this means that outside the capacitor plates, we have only conduction current</span> <span class="char-style-override">i</span><sub class="calibre9">c</sub> <span class="char-style-override">=</span> <span class="char-style-override">i,</span> <span class="char-style-override">and no displacement current, i.e.,</span> <span class="char-style-override">i</span><sub class="calibre9">d</sub> <span class="char-style-override">= 0. On the other hand, inside the capacitor, there is no conduction current, i.e.,</span> <span class="char-style-override">i</span><sub class="calibre9">c</sub> <span class="char-style-override">= 0, and there is only displacement current, so that</span> <span class="char-style-override">i</span><sub class="calibre9">d</sub> <span class="char-style-override">=</span> <span class="char-style-override">i</span><span class="char-style-override">.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The generalised (and correct) Ampere’s circuital law has the same form as Eq. (8.1), with one difference: “the</span> <span class="char-style-override">total current</span> <span class="char-style-override">passing through any surface of which the closed loop is the perimeter” is the sum of the conduction current and the displacement current. The generalised law is</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override"><img alt="l" src="images/000032.png" class="frame" />(8.6)</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">and is known as Ampere-Maxwell law.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">In all respects, the displacement current has the same physical effects as the conduction current. In some cases, for example, steady electric fields in a conducting wire, the displacement current may be zero since the electric field</span> <span class="char-style-override">E</span> <span class="char-style-override">does not change with time. In other cases, for example, the charging capacitor above, both conduction and displacement currents may be present in different regions of space. In most of the cases, they both may be present in the same region of space, as there exist no perfectly conducting or perfectly insulating medium. Most interestingly, there may be large regions of space where there is</span> <span class="char-style-override">no</span> <span class="char-style-override">conduction current, but there is only a displacement current due to time-varying electric fields. In such a region, we expect a magnetic field, though there is no (conduction) current source nearby! The prediction of such a displacement current can be verified experimentally. For example, a</span> <span class="char-style-override">magnetic</span> <span class="char-style-override">field (say at point M) between the plates of the capacitor in Fig. 8.2(a) can be measured and is seen to be the same as that just outside (at P).</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The displacement current has (literally) far reaching consequences. One thing we immediately notice is that the laws of electricity and magnetism are now more symmetrical</span><span class="char-style-override">*</span><span class="char-style-override">. Faraday’s law of induction states that there is an induced emf</span> <span class="char-style-override">equal to the rate of</span> <span class="char-style-override">change of magnetic flux. Now, since the emf between two points 1 and 2 is the work done per unit charge in taking it from 1 to 2, the existence of an emf implies the existence of an electric field. So, we can rephrase Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction by saying that a</span> <span class="char-style-override">magnetic field,</span> <span class="char-style-override">changing with time, gives rise to an</span> <span class="char-style-override">electric field.</span> <span class="char-style-override">Then, the fact that an</span> <span class="char-style-override">electric field</span> <span class="char-style-override">changing with</span> <span class="char-style-override">time gives rise to a</span> <span class="char-style-override">magnetic field,</span> <span class="char-style-override">is the symmetrical counterpart, and is a consequence of the displacement current being a source of a magnetic field. Thus, time- dependent electric and magnetic fields give rise to each other! Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction and Ampere-Maxwell law give a quantitative expression of this statement, with the current being the total current, as in Eq. (8.5). One very important consequence of this symmetry is the existence of electromagnetic waves, which we discuss qualitatively in the next section.</span></p>

      <p class="heading">8.3 ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES</p>

      <p class="subheading">8.3.1 Sources of electromagnetic waves</p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">How are electromagnetic waves produced? Neither stationary charges nor charges in uniform motion (steady currents) can be sources of electromagnetic waves. The former produces only electrostatic fields, while the latter produces magnetic fields that, however, do not vary with time. It is an important result of Maxwell’s theory that accelerated charges radiate electromagnetic waves. The proof of this basic result is beyond the scope of this book, but we can accept it on the basis of rough, qualitative reasoning. Consider a charge oscillating with some frequency. (An oscillating charge is an example of accelerating charge.) This produces an oscillating electric field in space, which produces an oscillating magnetic field, which in turn, is a source of oscillating electric field, and so on. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields thus regenerate each other, so to speak, as the wave propagates through the space.<br class="basic-graphics-frame" />
      The frequency of the electromagnetic wave naturally equals the&nbsp;frequency of oscillation of the charge. The energy associated with the propagating wave comes at the expense of the energy of the source &ndash; the accelerated charge.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">From the preceding discussion, it might appear easy to test the prediction that light is an electromagnetic wave. We might think that all we needed to do was to set up an ac circuit in which the current oscillate at the frequency of visible light, say, yellow light. But, alas, that is not possible. The frequency of yellow light is about 6 × 10</span><sup class="calibre7">14</sup> <span class="char-style-override">Hz, while the frequency that we get even with modern electronic circuits is hardly about 10</span><sup class="calibre7">11</sup> <span class="char-style-override">Hz. This is why the experimental demonstration of electromagnetic wave had to come in the low frequency region (the radio wave region), as in the Hertz’s experiment (1887).</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Hertz’s successful experimental test of Maxwell’s theory created a sensation and sparked off other important works in this field. Two important achievements in this connection deserve mention. Seven years after Hertz, Jagdish Chandra Bose, working at Calcutta (now Kolkata),</span> <span class="char-style-override">succeeded in producing and observing electromagnetic waves of much shorter wavelength (25 mm to 5 mm). His experiment, like that of Hertz’s, was confined to the laboratory.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">At around the same time, Guglielmo Marconi in Italy followed Hertz’s work and succeeded in transmitting electromagnetic waves over distances of many kilometres. Marconi’s experiment marks the beginning of the field of communication using electromagnetic waves.</span></p>

      <p class="subheading">8.3.2 Nature of electromagnetic waves</p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">It can be shown from Maxwell’s equations that electric and magnetic fields in an electromagnetic wave are perpendicular to each other,</span> <span class="char-style-override">and</span> <span class="char-style-override">to the direction of propagation. It appears reasonable, say from our discussion of the displacement current. Consider&nbsp;Fig. 8.2. The electric field inside the plates of the capacitor is directed perpendicular to the plates. The magnetic field this gives rise to via the displacement current is along the perimeter of a circle parallel to the capacitor plates. So</span> <span class="char-style-override">B</span> <span class="char-style-override">and</span> <span class="char-style-override">E</span> <span class="char-style-override">are perpendicular in this case. This is a general feature.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">We here make remarks on some features of electromagnetic waves. They are self-sustaining oscillations of electric and magnetic fields in free space, or vacuum. They differ from all the other waves we have studied so far, in respect that</span> <span class="char-style-override">no material medium</span> <span class="char-style-override">is involved in the vibrations of the electric and magnetic fields. Sound waves in air are longitudinal waves of compression and rarefaction. Transverse waves on the surface of water consist of water moving up and down as the wave spreads horizontally and radially onwards. Transverse elastic (sound) waves can also propagate in a solid, which is rigid and that resists shear. Scientists in the nineteenth century were so much used to this mechanical picture that they thought that there must be some medium pervading all space and all matter, which responds to electric and magnetic fields just as any elastic medium does. They called this medium</span> <span class="char-style-override">ether</span><span class="char-style-override">. They were so convinced of the reality of this medium, that there is even a novel called</span> <span class="char-style-override">The Poison Belt</span> <span class="char-style-override">by</span> <span class="char-style-override">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</span> <span class="char-style-override">(the creator of the famous detective</span> <span class="char-style-override">Sherlock Holmes</span><span class="char-style-override">) where the solar system is supposed to pass through a poisonous region of ether! We now accept that no such physical medium is needed. The famous experiment of Michelson and Morley in 1887 demolished conclusively the hypothesis of ether. Electric and magnetic fields, oscillating in space and time, can sustain each other in vacuum.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">But what if a material medium is actually there? We know that light, an electromagnetic wave, does propagate through glass, for example. We have seen earlier that the total electric and magnetic fields inside a medium are described in terms of a permittivity</span> <span class="char-style-override">ε</span> <span class="char-style-override">and a magnetic permeability</span> <span class="char-style-override">µ</span> <span class="char-style-override">(these describe the factors by which the total fields differ from the external fields).

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override"><span class="char-style-override"><img alt="1577.png" class="frame" src="images/000017.png" /></span></span> <span class="char-style-override">(8.11)</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Thus, the velocity of light depends on electric and magnetic properties of the medium. We shall see in the next chapter that the</span> <span class="char-style-override">refractive index</span> <span class="char-style-override">of one medium with respect to the other is equal to the ratio of velocities of light in the two media.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The velocity of electromagnetic waves in free space or vacuum is an important fundamental constant. It has been shown by experiments on electromagnetic waves of different wavelengths that this velocity is the same</span> <span class="char-style-override">(independent of wavelength) to within a few metres per second, out of a value of 3×10</span><sup class="calibre7">8</sup> <span class="char-style-override">m/s. The constancy of the velocity of em waves in vacuum is so strongly supported by experiments and the actual value is so well known now that this is used to define a standard of</span> <span class="char-style-override">length</span><span class="char-style-override">. Namely, the metre is now</span> <span class="char-style-override">defined</span> <span class="char-style-override">as the distance travelled by light in vacuum in a time (1/</span><span class="char-style-override">c</span><span class="char-style-override">) seconds = (2.99792458 × 10</span><sup class="calibre7">8</sup><span class="char-style-override">)</span><sup class="calibre7">&ndash;1</sup> <span class="char-style-override">seconds. This</span> <span class="char-style-override">has come about for the following reason. The basic unit of time can be defined very accurately in terms of some atomic frequency, i.e., frequency of light emitted by an atom in a particular process. The basic unit of length is harder to define as accurately in a direct way. Earlier measurement of</span> <span class="char-style-override">c</span> <span class="char-style-override">using earlier units of length (metre rods, etc.) converged to a value of about 2.9979246 × 10</span><sup class="calibre7">8</sup> <span class="char-style-override">m/s. Since</span> <span class="char-style-override">c</span> <span class="char-style-override">is such a strongly fixed number, unit of length can be defined in terms of</span> <span class="char-style-override">c</span> <span class="char-style-override">and the unit of time!</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Hertz not only showed the existence of electromagnetic waves, but also demonstrated that the waves, which had wavelength ten million times that of the light waves, could be diffracted, refracted and polarised. Thus, he conclusively established the wave nature of the radiation. Further, he produced stationary electromagnetic waves and determined their wavelength by measuring the distance between two successive nodes. Since the frequency of the wave was known (being equal to the frequency of the oscillator), he obtained the speed of the wave using the formula</span> <span class="char-style-override">v</span> <span class="char-style-override">=</span> <span class="char-style-override">νλ</span> <span class="char-style-override">and found that the waves travelled with the same speed as the speed of light.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The fact that electromagnetic waves are polarised can be easily seen in the response of a portable AM radio to a broadcasting station. If an AM radio has a telescopic antenna, it responds to the electric part of the signal. When the antenna is turned horizontal, the signal will be greatly diminished. Some portable radios have horizontal antenna (usually inside the case of radio), which are sensitive to the magnetic component of the electromagnetic wave. Such a radio must remain horizontal in order to receive the signal. In such cases, response also depends on the orientation of the radio with respect to the station.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">D</span><span class="char-style-override">o electromagnetic waves carry energy and momentum like other waves? Yes, they do. We have seen in chapter 2 that in a region of free space with electric field</span> <span class="char-style-override">E</span><span class="char-style-override">, there is an energy density (</span><span class="char-style-override">ε</span><sub class="calibre9">0</sub><span class="char-style-override">E</span><sup class="calibre7">2</sup><span class="char-style-override">/2). Similarly, as seen in Chapter 6, associated with a magnetic field</span> <span class="char-style-override">B</span> <span class="char-style-override">is a magnetic energy density (</span><span class="char-style-override">B</span><sup class="calibre7">2</sup><span class="char-style-override">/2</span><span class="char-style-override">µ</span><sub class="calibre9">0</sub><span class="char-style-override">). As electromagnetic wave contains both electric and magnetic fields, there is a non-zero energy density associated with it. Now consider a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the electromagnetic wave (Fig. 8.4). If there are, on this plane, electric charges, they will be set and sustained in motion by the electric and magnetic fields of the electromagnetic wave. The charges thus acquire energy and momentum from the waves. This just illustrates the fact that an electromagnetic wave (like other waves) carries energy and momentum. Since it carries momentum, an electromagnetic wave also exerts pressure, called</span> <span class="char-style-override">radiation pressure</span><span class="char-style-override">.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">When the sun shines on your hand, you feel the energy being absorbed from the electromagnetic waves (your hands get warm). Electromagnetic waves also transfer momentum to your hand but because</span> <span class="char-style-override">c</span> <span class="char-style-override">is very large, the amount of momentum transferred is extremely small and you do not feel the pressure. In 1903, the American scientists Nicols and Hull succeeded in measuring radiation pressure of&nbsp;visible light and verified Eq. (8.12).

Radar also provides the basis for the speed guns used to time fast balls, tennis- serves, and automobiles. Microwave ovens are an interesting domestic application of these waves. In such ovens, the frequency of the microwaves is selected to match the resonant frequency of water molecules so that energy from the waves is transferred efficiently to the kinetic energy of the molecules.

        <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Our objective is to cook food or warm it up. All food items such as fruit, vegetables, meat, cereals, etc., contain water as a constituent. Now, what does it mean when we say that a certain object has become warmer? When the temperature of a body rises, the energy of the random motion of atoms and molecules increases and the molecules travel or vibrate or rotate with higher energies. The frequency of rotation of water molecules is about 300 crore hertz, which is 3 gigahertz (GHz). If water receives microwaves of this frequency, its molecules absorb this radiation, which is equivalent to heating up water. These molecules share this energy with neighbouring food molecules, heating up the food.</span></p>

        <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override"><span class="char-style-override">One should use porcelain vessels and not metal containers in a microwave oven because of the danger of getting a shock from accumulated electric charges. Metals may also melt from heating.

Hence, they do not get heated up.</span></span></p>

        <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Thus</span><span class="char-style-override">, the basic principle of a microwave oven is to generate microwave radiation of appropriate frequency in the working space of the oven where we keep food. This way energy is not wasted in heating up the vessel. In the conventional heating method, the vessel on the burner gets heated first, and then the food inside gets heated because of transfer of energy from the vessel. In the microwave oven, on the other hand, energy is directly delivered to water molecules which is shared by the entire food.</span></p>

Infrared waves are sometimes referred to as</span> <span class="char-style-override">heat waves</span><span class="char-style-override">.

After absorption, their thermal motion increases, that is, they heat up and heat their surroundings. Infrared lamps are used in physical therapy. Infrared radiation also plays an important role in maintaining the earth’s warmth or average temperature through the greenhouse effect. Incoming visible light (which passes relatively easily through the atmosphere) is absorbed by the earth’s surface and re-radiated as infrared (longer wavelength) radiations. This radiation is trapped by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapour. Infrared detectors are used in Earth satellites, both for military purposes and to observe growth of crops. Electronic devices (for example semiconductor light emitting diodes) also emit infrared and are widely used in the remote switches of household electronic systems such as TV sets, video recorders and hi-fi systems.</span></p>

        <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">1. The basic difference between various types of electromagnetic waves lies in their wavelengths or frequencies since all of them travel through vacuum with the same speed. Consequently, the waves differ considerably in their mode of interaction with matter.</span></p>

        <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">2. Accelerated charged particles radiate electromagnetic waves. The wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is often correlated with the characteristic size of the system that radiates. Thus, gamma radiation, having wavelength of 10</span><sup class="calibre7">&ndash;14</sup> <span class="char-style-override">m to 10</span><sup class="calibre7">&ndash;15</sup> <span class="char-style-override">m, typically originate from an atomic nucleus. X-rays are emitted from heavy atoms. Radio waves are produced by accelerating electrons in a circuit. A transmitting antenna can most efficiently radiate waves having a wavelength of about the same size as the antenna. Visible radiation emitted by atoms is, however, much longer in wavelength than atomic size.</span></p>

        <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">3. The oscillating fields of an electromagnetic wave can accelerate charges and can produce oscillating currents. Therefore, an apparatus designed to detect electromagnetic waves is based on this fact. Hertz original ‘receiver’ worked in exactly this way. The same basic principle is utilised in practically all modern receiving devices. High frequency electromagnetic waves are detected by other means based on the physical effects they produce on interacting with matter.</span></p>

        <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">4. Infrared waves, with frequencies lower than those of visible light, vibrate not only the electrons, but entire atoms or molecules of a substance. This vibration increases the internal energy and consequently, the temperature of the substance.

        <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">(b) It is necessary to use satellites for long distance TV transmission. Why?</span></p>

        <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">(c) Optical and radiotelescopes are built on the ground but X-ray astronomy is possible only from satellites orbiting the earth. Why?</span></p>

        <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">(d) The small ozone layer on top of the stratosphere is crucial for human survival. Why?</span></p>

        <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">(e) If the earth did not have an atmosphere, would its average surface temperature be higher or lower than what it is now?</span></p>
