    <p class="heading">5.1 INTRODUCTION</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Magnetic phenomena are universal in nature. Vast, distant galaxies, the tiny invisible atoms, men and beasts all are permeated through and through with a host of magnetic fields from a variety of sources. The earth’s magnetism predates human evolution. The word magnet is derived from the name of an island in Greece called</span> <span class="char-style-override">magnesia</span> <span class="char-style-override">where magnetic ore deposits were found, as early as 600 BC. Shepherds on this island complained that their wooden shoes (which had nails) at times stayed struck to the ground. Their iron-tipped rods were similarly affected. This attractive property of magnets made it difficult for them to move around.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The directional property of magnets was also known since ancient times. A thin long piece of a magnet, when suspended freely, pointed in the north-south direction. A similar effect was observed when it was placed on a piece of cork which was then allowed to float in still water. The name</span> <span class="char-style-override">lodestone</span> <span class="char-style-override">(or</span> <span class="char-style-override">loadstone</span><span class="char-style-override">) given to a naturally occurring ore of iron-magnetite means leading stone. The technological exploitation of this property is generally credited to the Chinese. Chinese texts dating 400 BC mention the use of magnetic needles for navigation on ships. Caravans crossing the Gobi desert also employed magnetic needles.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">A Chinese legend narrates the tale of the victory of the emperor Huang-ti</span> <span class="char-style-override">about four thousand years ago, which he owed to his craftsmen (whom</span> <span class="char-style-override">nowadays you would call engineers). These ‘engineers’ built a chariot on which they placed a magnetic figure with arms outstretched. Figure 5.1 is an artist’s description of this chariot. The figure swiveled around so that the finger of the statuette on it always pointed south. With this chariot, Huang-ti’s troops were able&nbsp;to attack the enemy from the rear in thick fog, and to defeat them.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">In the previous chapter we have learned that moving charges or electric currents produce magnetic fields. This discovery, which was made in the early part of the nineteenth century is credited to Oersted, Ampere, Biot and Savart, among others.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override"><br class="basic-graphics-frame" /></span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">In the present chapter, we take a look at magnetism as a subject in its own right.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Some of the commonly known ideas regarding magnetism are:</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">(i) The earth behaves as a magnet with the magnetic field pointing approximately from the geographic south to the north.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">(ii) When a bar magnet is freely suspended, it points in the north-south direction. The tip which points to the geographic north is called the</span> <span class="char-style-override">north pole</span> <span class="char-style-override">and the tip which points to the geographic south is called the</span> <span class="char-style-override">south pole</span> <span class="char-style-override">of the magnet.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">(iii) There is a repulsive force when north poles ( or south poles ) of two magnets are brought close together. Conversely, there is an attractive force between the north pole of one magnet and the south pole of<br class="basic-graphics-frame" />
    the other.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">(iv) We cannot isolate the north, or south pole of a magnet. If a bar magnet is broken into two halves, we get two similar bar magnets with somewhat weaker properties. Unlike electric charges, isolated magnetic north and south poles known as</span> <span class="char-style-override">magnetic monopoles</span> <span class="char-style-override">do not exist.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">(v) It is possible to make magnets out of iron and its alloys.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">We begin with a description of a bar magnet and its behaviour in an external magnetic field. We describe Gauss’s law of magnetism. We then follow it up with an account of the earth’s magnetic field. We next describe how materials can be classified on the basis of their magnetic properties. We describe para-, dia-, and ferromagnetism. We conclude with a section on electromagnets and permanent magnets.</span></p>

    <p class="heading">5.2 THE BAR MAGNET</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">One of the earliest childhood memories of the famous physicist Albert Einstein was that of a magnet gifted to him by a relative. Einstein was fascinated, and played endlessly with it. He wondered how the magnet could affect objects such as nails or pins placed away from it and not in any way</span> <span class="char-style-override">connected</span> <span class="char-style-override">to it by a spring or string.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">We begin our study by examining iron filings sprinkled on a sheet of glass placed over a short bar magnet. The arrangement of iron filings is shown in Fig. 5.2.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The pattern of iron filings suggests that the magnet has two poles similar to the positive and negative charge of an electric dipole. As mentioned in the introductory section, one pole is designated the</span> <span class="char-style-override">North pole</span> <span class="char-style-override">and the other, the</span> <span class="char-style-override">South pole</span><span class="char-style-override">. When suspended freely, these poles point approximately towards the geographic north and south poles, respectively. A similar pattern of iron filings is observed around a current carrying solenoid.</span></p>

This is shown both for the bar-magnet and the current-carrying solenoid in&nbsp;Fig. 5.3. For comparison refer to the Chapter 1, Figure 1.17(d). Electric field lines of an electric dipole are also displayed in Fig. 5.3(c). The magnetic field lines are a visual and intuitive realisation of the magnetic field. Their properties are:</span></p>

    <p class="normal1"><span class="char-style-override">(i) The magnetic field lines of a magnet (or a solenoid) form continuous closed loops. This is unlike the electric dipole where these field lines begin from a positive charge and end on the negative charge or escape to infinity.</span></p>

    <p class="normal1"><span class="char-style-override">(ii) The tangent to the field line at a given point represents the direction of the net magnetic field</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">B</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">at that point.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">(iv) The magnetic field lines do not intersect, for if they did, the direction of the magnetic field would not be unique at the point of intersection.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The resemblance of magnetic field lines for a bar magnet and a solenoid suggest that a bar magnet may be thought of as a large number of circulating currents in analogy with a solenoid. Cutting a bar magnet in half is like cutting a solenoid. We get two smaller solenoids with weaker magnetic properties. The field lines remain continuous, emerging from one face of the solenoid and entering into the other face. One can test this analogy by moving a small compass needle in the neighbourhood of a bar magnet and a current-carrying finite solenoid and noting that the deflections of the needle are similar in both cases.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">To make this analogy more firm we calculate the axial field of a finite solenoid depicted in Fig. 5.4 (a). We shall demonstrate that at large distances this axial field resembles that of a bar magnet.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Let the solenoid of Fig. 5.4(a) consists of</span> <span class="char-style-override">n</span> <span class="char-style-override">turns per unit length. Let its length be 2</span><span class="char-style-override">l</span> <span class="char-style-override">and radius</span> <span class="char-style-override">a</span><span class="char-style-override">. We can evaluate the axial field</span> <span class="char-style-override">at a point P, at a distance</span> <span class="char-style-override">r</span> <span class="char-style-override">from the centre O of the solenoid. To do this, consider a circular element of thickness</span> <span class="char-style-override">dx</span> <span class="char-style-override">of the solenoid at a distance</span> <span class="char-style-override">x</span> <span class="char-style-override">from its centre.

Let</span> <span class="char-style-override">I</span> <span class="char-style-override">be the current in the solenoid. In Section 4.6 of the previous chapter we have calculated the magnetic field on the axis of a circular current loop. From Eq. (4.13), the magnitude of the field at point P due to the circular element is</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The magnitude of the total field is obtained by summing over all the elements &mdash; in other words by integrating from</span> <span class="char-style-override">x</span> <span class="char-style-override">= &ndash;</span> <span class="char-style-override">l</span> <span class="char-style-override">to</span> <span class="char-style-override">x</span> <span class="char-style-override">= +</span> <span class="char-style-override">l</span><span class="char-style-override">.

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">This integration can be done by trigonometric substitutions. This exercise, however, is not necessary for our purpose.

The field lines shown, in fact, represent electric field of a long positively charged wire. The correct magnetic field lines are circling the straight conductor, as described in Chapter 4.</span></p>

Magnetic field lines (like electric field lines) can never cross each other, because otherwise the direction of field at the point of intersection is ambiguous. There is further error in the figure. Magnetostatic field lines can never form closed loops around empty space. A closed loop of static magnetic field line must enclose a region across which a current is passing. By contrast, electrostatic field lines can never form closed loops, neither in empty space, nor when the loop encloses charges.</span></span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">(c)</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">Right</span><span class="char-style-override">. Magnetic lines are completely confined within a toroid. Nothing wrong here in field lines forming closed loops, since each loop encloses a region across which a current passes. Note, for clarity of figure, only a few field lines within the toroid have been shown. Actually, the entire region enclosed by the windings contains magnetic field.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">(d)</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">Wrong</span><span class="char-style-override">. Field lines due to a solenoid at its ends and outside cannot be so completely straight and confined; such a thing violates Ampere’s law. The lines should curve out at both ends, and meet eventually to form closed loops.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">(e)</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">Right</span><span class="char-style-override">. These are field lines outside and inside a bar magnet. Note carefully the direction of field lines inside. Not all field lines emanate out of a north pole (or converge into a south pole). Around both the N-pole, and the S-pole, the net flux of the field is zero.</span></p>

These field lines cannot possibly represent a magnetic field. Look at the upper region. All the field lines seem to emanate out of the shaded plate. The net flux through a surface surrounding the shaded plate is not zero. This is impossible for a magnetic field. The given field lines, in fact, show the electrostatic field lines around a positively charged upper plate and a negatively charged lower plate. The difference between Fig. [5.7(e) and (f)] should be carefully grasped.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">(g)</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">Wrong</span><span class="char-style-override">. Magnetic field lines between two pole pieces cannot be precisely straight at the ends. Some fringing of lines is inevitable. Otherwise, Ampere’s law is violated.

    <p class="heading">5.4 THE EARTH’S MAGNETISM</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Earlier we have referred to the magnetic field of the earth. The strength of the earth’s magnetic field varies from place to place on the earth’s surface; its value being of the order of 10</span><sup class="calibre8">&ndash;5</sup> <span class="char-style-override">T.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">What causes the earth to have a magnetic field is not clear. Originally the magnetic field was thought of as arising from a giant bar magnet placed approximately along the axis of rotation of the earth and deep in the interior. However, this simplistic picture is certainly not correct. The magnetic field is now thought to arise due to electrical currents produced by convective motion of metallic fluids (consisting mostly of molten&nbsp;iron and nickel) in the outer core of the earth. This is known as the</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">dynamo effect</span><span class="char-style-override">.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The magnetic field lines of the earth resemble that of a (hypothetical) magnetic dipole located at the centre of the earth. The axis of the dipole does not coincide with the axis of rotation of the earth but is presently titled by approximately 11.3" with respect to the later. In this way of looking at it, the magnetic poles are located where the magnetic field lines due to the dipole enter or leave the earth. The location of the north m</span><span class="char-style-override">agnetic pole is at a latitude of 79.74" N and a longitude of 71.8" W, a place somewhere in north Canada. The magnetic south pole is at 79.74" S</span><span class="char-style-override">, 108.22" E in the Antarctica.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The pole near the geographic north pole of the earth is called the</span> <span class="char-style-override">north magnetic pole</span><span class="char-style-override">. Likewise, the pole near the geographic south pole is called</span> <span class="char-style-override">the</span> <span class="char-style-override">south magnetic pole</span><span class="char-style-override">. There is some confusion in the nomenclature of</span> <span class="char-style-override">the poles. If one looks at the magnetic field lines of the earth (Fig. 5.8), one sees that unlike in the case of a bar magnet, the field lines go into the earth at the north magnetic pole (</span><span class="char-style-override">N</span><sub class="calibre9">m</sub><span class="char-style-override">) and come out from the south magnetic pole (</span><span class="char-style-override">S</span><sub class="calibre9">m</sub><span class="char-style-override">). The convention arose because the magnetic north was the direction to which the north&nbsp;pole of a magnetic needle pointed; the north pole of&nbsp;a magnet was so named as it was the</span> <span class="char-style-override">north seeking&nbsp;pole</span><span class="char-style-override">. Thus, in reality, the north magnetic pole behaves like the south pole of a bar magnet inside the earth and vice versa.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">A compass needle consists of a magnetic needle which floats on a pivotal point. When the compass is held level, it points along the direction of the horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic field at the location. Thus, the compass needle would stay along the magnetic meridian of the place. In some places on the earth there are deposits of magnetic minerals which cause the compass needle to deviate from the magnetic meridian. Knowing the magnetic declination at a place allows us to correct the compass to determine the direction of true north.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">So what happens if we take our compass to the magnetic pole? At the poles, the magnetic field lines are converging or diverging vertically so that the horizontal component is negligible. If the needle is only capable of moving in a horizontal plane, it can point along any direction, rendering it useless as a direction finder. What one needs in such a case is a</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">dip needle</span>&nbsp;<span class="char-style-override">which is a compass pivoted to move in a vertical plane containing the magnetic field of the earth. The needle of the compass then shows the angle which the magnetic field makes with the vertical. At the magnetic poles such a needle will point straight down.</span></p>

        <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">It must not be assumed that there is a giant bar magnet deep inside the earth which is causing the earth’s magnetic field. Although there are large deposits of iron inside the earth, it is highly unlikely that a large solid block of iron stretches from the magnetic north pole to the magnetic south pole. The earth’s core is very hot and molten, and the ions of iron and nickel are responsible for earth’s magnetism. This hypothesis seems very probable. Moon, which has no molten core, has no magnetic field, Venus has a slower rate of rotation, and a weaker magnetic field, while Jupiter, which has the fastest rotation rate among planets, has a fairly strong magnetic field. However, the precise mode of these circulating currents and the energy needed to sustain them are not very well understood. These are several open questions which form an important area of continuing research.</span></p>

        <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The variation of the earth’s magnetic field with position is also an interesting area of study. Charged particles emitted by the sun flow towards the earth and beyond, in a stream called the solar wind. Their motion is affected by the earth’s magnetic field, and in turn, they affect the pattern of the earth’s magnetic field. The pattern of magnetic field near the poles is quite different from that in other regions of the earth.</span></p>

        <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The variation of earth’s magnetic field with time is no less fascinating. There are short term variations taking place over centuries and long term variations taking place over a period of a million years. In a span of 240 years from 1580 to 1820 AD, over which records are available, the magnetic declination at London has been found to change by 3.5", suggesting that the magnetic poles inside the earth change position with time. On the scale of a million years, the earth’s magnetic fields has been found to reverse its direction.&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Basalt contains iron, and basalt is emitted during volcanic activity. The little iron magnets inside it align themselves parallel to the magnetic field at that place as the basalt cools and solidifies. Geological studies of basalt containing such pieces of magnetised region have provided evidence for the change of direction of earth’s magnetic field, several times in the past.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The simplest explanation for diamagnetism is as follows. Electrons in an atom orbiting around nucleus possess orbital angular momentum. These orbiting electrons are equivalent to current-carrying loop and thus possess orbital magnetic moment. Diamagnetic substances are the ones in which resultant magnetic moment in an atom is zero. When magnetic field is applied, those electrons having orbital magnetic moment in the same direction slow down and those in the opposite direction speed up. This happens due to induced current in accordance with Lenz’s law which you will study in Chapter 6. Thus, the substance develops a net magnetic moment in direction opposite to that of the applied field and hence repulsion.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Some diamagnetic materials are bismuth, copper, lead, silicon, nitrogen (at STP), water and sodium chloride. Diamagnetism is present in all the substances. However, the effect is so weak in most cases that it gets shifted by other effects like paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, etc.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The hysteresis curve (Fig. 5.14) allows us to select suitable materials for permanent magnets. The material should have high retentivity so that the magnet is strong and high coercivity so that the magnetisation is not erased by stray magnetic fields, temperature fluctuations or minor mechanical damage. Further, the material should have a high permeability. Steel is one-favoured choice. It has a slightly smaller retentivity than soft iron but this is outweighed by the much smaller coercivity of soft iron. Other suitable materials for permanent magnets are alnico, cobalt steel and ticonal.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Core of electromagnets are made of ferromagnetic materials which have high permeability and low retentivity. Soft iron is a suitable material for electromagnets. On placing a soft iron rod in a solenoid and passing a current, we increase the magnetism of the solenoid by a thousand fold. When we switch off the solenoid current, the magnetism is effectively switched off since the soft iron core has a low retentivity. The arrangement is shown in Fig. 5.16.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Because of its practical application in prospecting, communication, and navigation, the magnetic field of the earth is mapped by most nations with an accuracy comparable to geographical mapping. In India over a dozen observatories exist, extending from Trivandrum (now Thrivuvananthapuram) in the south to Gulmarg in the north. These observatories work under the aegis of the Indian Institute of Geomagnetism (IIG), in Colaba, Mumbai. The IIG grew out of the Colaba and Alibag observatories and was formally established in 1971. The IIG monitors (via its nation-wide observatories), the geomagnetic fields and fluctuations on land, and under the ocean and in space. Its services are used by the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. (ONGC), the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It is a part of the world-wide network which ceaselessly updates the geomagnetic data. Now India has a permanent station called Gangotri.</span></p>

      <p class="calibre4"><span class="char-style-override"><b class="calibre10">POINTS TO PONDER</b></span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">1. A satisfactory understanding of magnetic phenomenon in terms of moving charges/currents was arrived at after 1800 AD. But technological exploitation of the directional properties of magnets predates this scientific understanding by two thousand years. Thus, scientific understanding is not a necessary condition for engineering applications. Ideally, science and engineering go hand-in-hand, one leading and assisting the other in tandem.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">2. Magnetic monopoles do not exist. If you slice a magnet in half, you get two smaller magnets. On the other hand, isolated positive and negative charges exist. There exists a smallest unit of charge, for example, the electronic charge with value |</span><span class="char-style-override">e</span><span class="char-style-override">| = 1.6 ×10</span><sup class="calibre8">&ndash;19</sup> <span class="char-style-override">C. All other charges are integral multiples of this smallest unit charge. In other words, charge is quantised. We do not know why magnetic monopoles do not exist or why electric charge is quantised.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">3. A consequence of the fact that magnetic monopoles do not exist is that the magnetic field lines are continuous and form closed loops. In contrast, the electrostatic lines of force begin on a positive charge and terminate on the negative charge (or fade out at infinity).</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">4. The earth’s magnetic field is not due to a huge bar magnet inside it. The earth’s core is hot and molten. Perhaps convective currents in this core are responsible for the earth’s magnetic field. As to what ‘dynamo’ effect sustains this current, and why the earth’s field reverses polarity every million years or so, we do not know.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">5. A miniscule difference in the value of</span> <span class="char-style-override">χ</span><span class="char-style-override">,</span> <span class="char-style-override">the magnetic susceptibility, yields radically different behaviour: diamagnetic versus paramagnetic. For diamagnetic materials</span> <span class="char-style-override">χ</span> <span class="char-style-override">=</span> <span class="char-style-override">&ndash;</span><span class="char-style-override">10</span><sup class="calibre8">&ndash;5</sup> <span class="char-style-override">whereas</span> <span class="char-style-override">χ</span> <span class="char-style-override">= +10</span><sup class="calibre8">&ndash;5</sup> <span class="char-style-override">for paramagnetic materials.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">6. There exists</span> <span class="char-style-override">a perfect diamagnet</span><span class="char-style-override">, namely, a superconductor. This is a metal at very low temperatures. In this case</span> <span class="char-style-override">χ</span> <span class="char-style-override">=</span> <span class="char-style-override">&ndash;1,</span> <span class="char-style-override">µ</span><sub class="calibre9">r</sub> <span class="char-style-override">= 0,</span> <span class="char-style-override">µ</span> <span class="char-style-override">= 0. The external magnetic field is totally expelled. Interestingly, this material is also a perfect conductor. However, there exists no classical theory which ties these two properties together. A quantum-mechanical theory by Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS theory) explains these effects. The BCS theory was proposed in1957 and was eventually recognised by a Nobel Prize in physics in 1970.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">7. The phenomenon of magnetic hysteresis is reminiscent of similar&nbsp;behaviour concerning the elastic properties of materials. Strain&nbsp;may not be proportional to stress; here</span> <span class="char-style-override">H</span> <span class="char-style-override">and</span> <span class="char-style-override">B</span> <span class="char-style-override">(or</span> <span class="char-style-override">M</span><span class="char-style-override">) are not&nbsp;linearly related. The stress-strain curve exhibits hysteresis and&nbsp;area enclosed by it represents the energy dissipated per unit volume.&nbsp;A similar interpretation can be given to the</span> <span class="char-style-override">B</span><span class="char-style-override">-</span><span class="char-style-override">H</span> <span class="char-style-override">magnetic hysteresis&nbsp;curve.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">8. Diamagnetism is universal. It is present in all materials. But it&nbsp;is weak and hard to detect if the substance is para- or ferromagnetic.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">9. We have classified materials as diamagnetic, paramagnetic, and ferromagnetic. However, there exist additional types of magnetic material such as ferrimagnetic, anti-ferromagnetic, spin glass, etc. with properties which are exotic and mysterious.</span></p>
