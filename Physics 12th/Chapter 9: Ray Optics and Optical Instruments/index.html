    </div>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">Nature has endowed the human eye (retina) with the sensitivity to detect electromagnetic waves within a small range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Electromagnetic radiation belonging to this region of the spectrum (wavelength of about 400 nm to 750 nm) is called light. It is mainly through light and the sense of vision that we know and interpret the world around us.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">There are two things that we can intuitively mention about light from common experience. First, that it travels with enormous speed and second, that it travels in a straight line. It took some time for people to realise that the speed of light is finite and measurable. Its presently accepted value in vacuum is</span> <span class="char-style-override">c</span> <span class="char-style-override">= 2.99792458 × 10</span><span class="char-style-override1"><sup class="calibre9">8</sup></span> <span class="char-style-override">m s</span><span class="char-style-override1"><sup class="calibre9">&ndash;1</sup></span><span class="char-style-override">. For many purposes, it suffices to take</span> <span class="char-style-override">c</span> <span class="char-style-override">= 3 × 10</span><span class="char-style-override1"><sup class="calibre9">8</sup></span> <span class="char-style-override">m s</span><span class="char-style-override1"><sup class="calibre9">&ndash;1</sup></span><span class="char-style-override">. The speed of light in vacuum is the highest speed attainable in nature.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">The intuitive notion that light travels in a straight line seems to contradict what we have learnt in Chapter 8, that light is an electromagnetic wave of wavelength belonging to the visible part of the spectrum. How to reconcile the two facts? The answer is that the wavelength of light is very small compared to the size of ordinary objects that we encounter commonly (generally of the order of a few cm or larger). In this situation, as you will learn in Chapter 10, a light wave can be considered to travel from one point to another, along a straight line joining</span> <span class="char-style-override">them. The path is called a</span> <span class="char-style-override">ray</span> <span class="char-style-override">of light, and a bundle of such rays constitutes a</span> <span class="char-style-override">beam</span> <span class="char-style-override">of light.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">In this chapter, we consider the phenomena of reflection, refraction and dispersion of light, using the ray picture of light. Using the basic laws of reflection and refraction, we shall study the image formation by plane and spherical reflecting and refracting surfaces. We then go on to describe the construction and working of some important optical instruments, including the human eye.</span></p>

        <p class="calibre8"></p>

        <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">Newton’s fundamental contributions to mathematics, mechanics, and gravitation often blind us to his deep experimental and theoretical study of light. He made pioneering contributions in the field of optics. He further developed the corpuscular model of light proposed by Descartes. It presumes that light energy is concentrated in tiny particles called</span> <span class="char-style-override">corpuscles</span><span class="char-style-override">. He further assumed that corpuscles of light were massless elastic particles. With his understanding of mechanics, he could come up with a simple model of reflection and refraction. It is a common observation that a ball bouncing from a smooth plane surface obeys the laws of reflection. When this is an elastic collision, the magnitude of the velocity remains the same. As the surface is smooth, there is no force acting parallel to the surface, so the component of momentum in this direction also remains the same. Only the component perpendicular to the surface, i.e., the normal component of the momentum, gets reversed in reflection. Newton argued that smooth surfaces like mirrors reflect the corpuscles in a similar manner.</span></p>

        <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">In order to explain the phenomena of refraction, Newton postulated that the speed of the corpuscles was greater in water or glass than in air. However, later on it was discovered that the speed of light is less in water or glass than in air.</span></p>

        <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">In the field of optics, Newton &ndash; the experimenter, was greater than Newton &ndash; the theorist. He himself observed many phenomena, which were difficult to understand in terms of particle nature of light. For example, the colours observed due to a thin film of oil on water. Property of partial reflection of light is yet another such example. Everyone who has looked into the water in a pond sees image of the face in it, but also sees the bottom of the pond. Newton argued that some of the corpuscles, which fall on the water, get reflected and some get transmitted. But what property could distinguish these two kinds of corpuscles? Newton had to postulate some kind of unpredictable, chance phenomenon, which decided whether an individual corpuscle would be reflected or not. In explaining other phenomena, however, the corpuscles were presumed to behave as if they are identical. Such a dilemma does not occur in the wave picture of light. An incoming wave can be divided into two weaker waves at the boundary between air and water.</span></p>

    <h1 class="calibre6">9.2 Reflection of Light by Spherical Mirrors</h1>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override"><br class="calibre5" />
    We are familiar with the laws of reflection. The angle of reflection (i.e., the angle between reflected ray and the normal to the reflecting surface or the mirror) equals the angle of incidence (angle between incident ray and the normal). Also that the incident ray, reflected ray and the normal to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence lie in the same plane<br class="calibre5" />
    (Fig. 9.1). These laws are valid at each point on any reflecting surface whether plane or curved. However, we shall restrict our discussion to the special case of curved surfaces, that is, spherical surfaces. The normal in this case is to be taken as normal to the tangent to surface at the point of incidence. That is, the normal is along the radius, the line joining the centre of curvature of the mirror to the point of incidence.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">We have already studied that the geometric centre of a spherical mirror is called its pole while that of a spherical lens is called its optical centre. The line joining the pole and the centre of curvature of the spherical mirror is known as the</span> <span class="char-style-override">principal axis</span><span class="char-style-override">. In the case of spherical lenses, the principal axis is the line joining the optical centre with its principal focus as you will see later.</span></p>

    <p class="subheading">9.2.1 Sign convention</p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override"><br class="calibre5" />
    To derive the relevant formulae for reflection by spherical mirrors and refraction by spherical lenses, we must first adopt a sign convention for measuring distances. In this book, we shall follow the</span> <span class="char-style-override">Cartesian sign convention</span><span class="char-style-override">. According to this convention, all distances are measured from the pole of the mirror or the optical centre of the lens. The distances measured in the same direction as the incident light are taken as positive and those measured in the direction opposite to the direction of incident light are taken as negative (Fig. 9.2). The heights measured upwards with respect to</span> <span class="char-style-override">x</span><span class="char-style-override">-axis and normal to the principal axis (</span><span class="char-style-override">x</span><span class="char-style-override">-axis) of the mirror/lens are taken as positive (Fig. 9.2). The heights measured downwards are taken as negative.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">With a common accepted convention, it turns out that a single formula for spherical mirrors and a single formula for spherical lenses can handle all different cases.</span></p>

    <p class="subheading">9.2.2 Focal length of spherical mirrors</p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override"><br class="calibre5" />
    Figure 9.3 shows what happens when a parallel beam of light is incident on (a) a concave mirror, and (b) a convex mirror. We assume that the rays are</span> <span class="char-style-override">paraxial</span><span class="char-style-override">, i.e., they are incident at points close to the pole P of the mirror and make small angles with the principal axis. The reflected rays converge at a point F on the principal axis of a concave mirror [Fig. 9.3(a)].<br class="calibre5" />
    For a convex mirror, the reflected rays appear to diverge from a point F on its principal axis [Fig. 9.3(b)]. The point F is called the</span> <span class="char-style-override">principal focus</span> <span class="char-style-override">of the mirror. If the parallel paraxial beam of light were incident, making some angle with the principal axis, the reflected rays would</span> <span class="char-style-override">converge (or appear to diverge) from a point in a plane through F normal to the principal axis. This is called the</span> <span class="char-style-override">focal plane</span> <span class="char-style-override">of the mirror [Fig. 9.3(c)].</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">The distance between the focus F and the pole P of the mirror is called the</span> <span class="char-style-override">focal length</span> <span class="char-style-override">of the mirror, denoted by</span> <span class="char-style-override">f</span><span class="char-style-override">.

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">Some elementary results based on the laws of refraction follow immediately. For a rectangular slab, refraction takes place at two interfaces (air-glass and glass-air).

Another familiar observation is that the bottom of a tank filled with water appears to be raised (Fig. 9.10).

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">The refraction of light through the atmosphere is responsible for many interesting phenomena. For example, the sun is visible a little before the actual sunrise and until a little after the actual sunset due to refraction of light through the atmosphere (Fig. 9.11). By actual sunrise we mean the actual crossing of the horizon by the sun. Figure 9.11 shows the actual and apparent positions of the sun with respect to the horizon. The figure is highly exaggerated to show the effect. The refractive index of air with respect to vacuum is 1.00029. Due to this, the apparent shift in the direction of the sun is by about half a degree and the corresponding time difference between actual sunset and apparent sunset is about 2 minutes (see Example 9.5). The apparent flattening (oval shape) of the sun at sunset and sunrise is also due to the same phenomenon.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">All optical phenomena can be demonstrated very easily with the use of a laser torch or pointer, which is easily available nowadays. Take a glass beaker with clear water in it. Stir the water a few times with a piece of soap, so that it becomes a little turbid. Take a laser pointer and shine its beam through the turbid water. You will find that the path of the beam inside the water shines brightly.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">Shine the beam from below the beaker such that it strikes at the upper water surface at the other end. Do you find that it undergoes partial reflection (which is seen as a spot on the table below) and partial refraction [</span><span class="char-style-override">which comes out in the air and is seen as a spot on the roof; Fig. 9.13(a)</span><span class="char-style-override">]? Now direct the laser beam from one side of the beaker such that it strikes the upper surface of water more obliquely [Fig. 9.13(b)]. Adjust the direction of laser beam until you find the angle for which the refraction above the water surface is totally absent and the beam is totally reflected back to water. This is total internal reflection at its simplest.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">Pour this water in a long test tube and shine the laser light from top, as shown in Fig. 9.13(c). Adjust the direction of the laser beam such that it is totally internally reflected every time it strikes the walls of the tube. This is similar to what happens in optical fibres.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">Take care not to look into the laser beam directly and not to point it at anybody’s face.</span></p>

Thus, a ray of light from such an object successively bends away from the normal and undergoes total internal reflection, if the angle of incidence for the air near the ground exceeds the critical angle. This is shown in Fig. 9.14(b). To a distant observer, the light appears to be coming from somewhere below the ground. The observer naturally assumes that light is being reflected from the ground, say, by a pool of water near the tall object.

Optical fibres too make use of the phenomenon of total internal reflection. Optical fibres are fabricated with high quality composite glass/quartz fibres. Each fibre consists of a core and cladding. The refractive index of the material of the core is higher than that of the cladding.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">When a signal in the form of light is directed at one end of the fibre at a suitable angle, it undergoes repeated total internal reflections along the length of the fibre and finally comes out at the other end (Fig. 9.16). Since light undergoes total internal reflection at each stage, there is no appreciable loss in the intensity of the light signal. Optical fibres are fabricated such that light reflected at one side of inner surface strikes the other at an angle larger than the critical angle. Even if the fibre is bent, light can easily travel along its length. Thus, an optical fibre can be used to act as an optical pipe.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">A bundle of optical fibres can be put to several uses. Optical fibres are extensively used for transmitting and receiving electrical signals which are converted to light by suitable transducers. Obviously, optical fibres can also be used for transmission of optical signals. For example, these are used as a ‘light pipe’ to facilitate visual examination of internal organs like esophagus, stomach and intestines. You might have seen a commonly</span> <span class="char-style-override">available decorative lamp with fine plastic fibres with their free ends forming a fountain like structure. The other end of the fibres is fixed over an electric lamp. When the lamp is switched on, the light travels from the bottom of each fibre and appears at the tip of its free end as a dot of light. The fibres in such decorative lamps are optical fibres.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">The main requirement in fabricating optical fibres is that there should be very little absorption of light as it travels for long distances inside them. This has been achieved by purification and special preparation of materials such as quartz. In silica glass fibres, it is possible to transmit more than 95% of the light over a fibre length of 1 km. (Compare with what you expect for a block of ordinary window glass 1 km thick.)</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">We have so far considered refraction at a plane interface. We shall now consider refraction at a spherical interface between two transparent media. An infinitesimal part of a spherical surface can be regarded as planar and the same laws of refraction can be applied at every point on the surface. Just as for reflection by a spherical mirror, the normal at the point of incidence is perpendicular to the tangent plane to the spherical surface at that point and, therefore, passes through its centre of curvature. We first consider refraction by a single spherical surface and follow it by thin lenses. A thin lens is a transparent optical medium bounded by two surfaces; at least one of which should be spherical. Applying the formula for image formation by a single spherical surface successively at the two surfaces of a lens, we shall obtain the lens maker’s formula and then the lens formula.</span></p>

      <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override"><br class="calibre5" /></span></p>

      <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">It is known that a body above absolute zero temperature emits electromagnetic radiation. The wavelength region in which the body emits the radiation depends on its absolute temperature. Radiation emitted by a hot body, for example, a tungsten filament lamp having temperature 2850 K are partly invisible and mostly in infrared (or heat) region. As the temperature of the body increases radiation emitted by it is in visible region. The sun with temperature of about 5500 K emits radiation whose energy versus wavelength graph peaks approximately at 550 nm corresponding to green light and is almost in the middle of the visible region. The energy versus wavelength distribution graph for a given body peaks at some wavelength, which is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature of that body.</span></p>

      <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">The measurement of light as perceived by human eye is called</span> <span class="char-style-override">photometry</span><span class="char-style-override">. Photometry is measurement of a physiological phenomenon, being the stimulus of light as received by the human eye, transmitted by the optic nerves and analysed by the brain. The main physical quantities in photometry are (i) the</span> <span class="char-style-override">luminous intensity</span> <span class="char-style-override">of the source, (ii) the</span> <span class="char-style-override">luminous flux</span> <span class="char-style-override">or flow of light from the source, and (iii)</span> <span class="char-style-override">illuminance</span> <span class="char-style-override">of the surface. The SI unit of</span> <span class="char-style-override">luminous intensity</span> <span class="char-style-override">(</span><span class="char-style-override">I</span><span class="char-style-override">) is candela (cd). The candela is the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 × 10</span><span class="char-style-override1">12</span> <span class="char-style-override">Hz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per steradian. If a light source emits one candela of luminous intensity into a solid angle of one steradian, the total luminous flux emitted into that solid angle is one</span> <span class="char-style-override">lumen</span> <span class="char-style-override">(lm). A standard 100 watt incadescent light bulb emits approximately 1700 lumens.</span></p>

      <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">In photometry, the only parameter, which can be measured directly is</span> <span class="char-style-override">illuminance</span><span class="char-style-override">. It is defined as luminous flux incident per unit area on a surface (lm/m</span><span class="char-style-override1">2</span> <span class="char-style-override">or</span> <span class="char-style-override">lu</span><span class="char-style-override">x</span><span class="char-style-override">). Most light meters measure this quantity. The illuminance</span> <span class="char-style-override">E</span><span class="char-style-override">, produced by a source of luminous intensity</span> <span class="char-style-override">I</span><span class="char-style-override">, is given by</span> <span class="char-style-override">E</span> <span class="char-style-override">=</span> <span class="char-style-override">I</span><span class="char-style-override">/</span><span class="char-style-override">r</span><span class="char-style-override1">2</span><span class="char-style-override">, where</span> <span class="char-style-override">r</span> <span class="char-style-override">is the normal distance of the surface from the source. A quantity named</span> <span class="char-style-override">luminance</span> <span class="char-style-override">(</span><span class="char-style-override">L</span><span class="char-style-override">), is used to characterise the brightness of emitting or reflecting flat surfaces. Its unit is cd/m</span><span class="char-style-override1">2</span> <span class="char-style-override">(sometimes called ‘nit’ in industry)</span> <span class="char-style-override">. A good LCD computer monitor has a brightness of about 250 nits.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">Equation (9.23) is the familiar</span> <span class="char-style-override">thin lens formula</span><span class="char-style-override">. Though we derived it for a real image formed by a convex lens, the formula is valid for both convex as well as concave lenses and for both real and virtual images.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">It is worth mentioning that the two foci, F and F</span><span class="char-style-override">′</span><span class="char-style-override">, of a double convex or concave lens are equidistant from the optical centre.

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">To find the image of an object by a lens, we can, in principle, take any two rays emanating from a point on an object; trace their paths using the laws of refraction and find the point where the refracted rays meet (or appear to meet).

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">(i) A ray emanating from the object parallel to the principal axis of the lens after refraction passes through the second principal focus</span> <span class="char-style-override">F</span><span class="char-style-override">′</span> <span class="char-style-override">(in a convex lens) or appears to diverge (in</span> <span class="char-style-override">a concave lens) from the first principal focus F.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">(ii) A ray of light, passing through the optical centre of the lens, emerges without any deviation after refraction.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override"><br class="calibre5" />
    Power of a lens is a measure of the convergence or divergence, which a lens introduces in the light falling on it. Clearly, a lens of shorter focal length bends the incident light more,</span> <span class="char-style-override">while converging it in case of a convex lens and diverging it in case of a concave lens. The</span> <span class="char-style-override">power</span> <span class="char-style-override">P</span> <span class="char-style-override">of a lens is defined as the tangent of the angle by which it converges or diverges a beam of light falling at unit distant from the optical centre (Fig. 9.20).</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override"><span class="char-style-override"><img alt="3084.png" class="frame" src="images/000059.png" /></span> or <span class="char-style-override"><img alt="3089.png" class="frame" src="images/000072.png" /></span> for small value of</span> <span class="char-style-override">δ</span><span class="char-style-override">.

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">The SI unit for power of a lens is dioptre (D): 1D = 1m</span><sup class="calibre9">&ndash;1</sup><span class="char-style-override">. The power of a lens of focal length of 1 metre is one dioptre. Power of a lens is positive for a converging lens and negative for a diverging lens. Thus, when an optician prescribes a corrective lens of power + 2.5 D, the required lens is a convex lens of focal length + 40 cm. A lens of power of &ndash; 4.0 D means a concave lens of focal length &ndash; 25 cm.</span></p>

    <h1 class="calibre6">9.7 Dispersion by a Prism</h1>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override"><br class="calibre5" /></span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">It has been known for a long time that when a narrow beam of sunlight, usually called white light, is incident on a glass prism, the emergent light is seen to be consisting of several colours. There is actually a continuous variation of colour, but broadly, the different component colours that appear in sequence are:</span> <span class="char-style-override">v</span><span class="char-style-override">iolet,</span> <span class="char-style-override">i</span><span class="char-style-override">ndigo,</span> <span class="char-style-override">b</span><span class="char-style-override">lue,</span> <span class="char-style-override">g</span><span class="char-style-override">reen,</span> <span class="char-style-override">y</span><span class="char-style-override">ellow,</span> <span class="char-style-override">o</span><span class="char-style-override">range and</span> <span class="char-style-override">r</span><span class="char-style-override">ed (given by the acronym VIBGYOR). The red light bends the least, while the violet light bends the most (Fig. 9.25).</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">The phenomenon of splitting of light into its component colours is known as</span> <span class="char-style-override">dispersion</span><span class="char-style-override">. The pattern of colour components of light is called the spectrum of light. The word</span> <span class="char-style-override">spectrum</span> <span class="char-style-override">is now used in a much more general sense: we discussed in Chapter 8 the electro- magnetic spectrum over the large range of wavelengths, from</span> <span class="char-style-override">γ</span><span class="char-style-override">-rays to radio waves, of which the spectrum of light (visible spectrum) is only a small part.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">Though the reason for appearance of spectrum is now common knowledge, it was a matter of much debate in the history of physics. Does the prism itself create colour in some way or does it only separate the colours already present in white light?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">In a classic experiment known for its simplicity but great significance, Isaac Newton settled the issue once for all. He put another similar prism, but in an inverted position, and let the emergent beam from the first prism fall on the second prism (Fig. 9.26). The resulting emergent beam was found to be white light. The explanation was clear&mdash; the first prism splits the white light into its component colours, while the inverted prism recombines them to give white light. Thus, white light itself consists of light of different colours, which are separated by the prism.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">It must be understood here that a ray of light, as defined mathematically, does not exist. An actual ray is really a beam of many rays of light. Each ray splits into component colours when it enters the glass prism. When those coloured rays come out on the other side, they again produce a white beam.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">We now know that colour is associated with wavelength of light. In the visible spectrum, red light is at the long wavelength end (~700 nm) while the violet light is at the short wavelength end (~ 400 nm). Dispersion takes place because the refractive index of medium for different wavelengths (colours) is different. For example, the bending</span> <span class="char-style-override">of red component of white light is least while it is most for the violet. Equivalently, red light travels faster than violet light in a glass prism. Table 9.2 gives the refractive indices for different wavelength for crown glass and flint glass. Thick lenses could be assumed as made of many prisms, therefore, thick lenses show</span> <span class="char-style-override">chromatic aberration</span> <span class="char-style-override">due to dispersion of light.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override"><br class="calibre5" /></span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">The variation of refractive index with wavelength may be more pronounced in some media than the other. In vacuum, of course, the speed of light is independent of wavelength. Thus, vacuum (or air approximately) is a non-dispersive medium in which all colours travel with the same speed. This also follows from the fact that sunlight reaches us in the form of white light and not as its components. On the other hand, glass is a dispersive medium.</span></p>

    <h1 class="calibre6">9.8 Some Natural Phenomena due to Sunlight</h1>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override"><br class="calibre5" /></span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">The interplay of light with things around us gives rise to several beautiful phenomena. The spectacle of colour that we see around us all the time is possible only due to sunlight. The blue of the sky, white clouds, the red-hue at sunrise and sunset, the rainbow, the brilliant colours of some pearls, shells, and wings of birds, are just a few of the natural wonders we are used to. We describe some of them here from the point of view of physics.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override"><br class="calibre5" /></span></p>

    <p class="subheading">9.8.1 The rainbow</p>

    <p class="subheading"><br class="calibre5" /></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">The rainbow is an example of the dispersion of sunlight by the water drops in the atmosphere. This is a phenomenon due to combined effect of dispersion, refraction and reflection of sunlight by spherical water droplets of rain. The conditions for observing a rainbow are that the sun should be shining in one part of the sky (say near western horizon) while it is raining in the opposite part of the sky (say eastern horizon).<br class="calibre5" />
    An observer can therefore see a rainbow only when his back is towards the sun.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">In order to understand the formation of rainbows, consider Fig. (9.27(a). Sunlight is first refracted as it enters a raindrop, which causes the different wavelengths (colours) of white light to separate. Longer wangelength of light (red) are bent the least while the shorter wavelength (violet) are bent the most. Next, these component rays strike the inner</span> <span class="char-style-override">surface of the water drop and get internally reflected if the angle between the refracted ray and normal to the drop surface is greater then the critical angle (48º, in this case). The reflected light is refracted again as it comes out of the drop as shown in the figure. It is found that the violet light emerges at an angle of 40º related to the incoming sunlight and red light emerges at an angle of 42º. For other colours, angles lie in between these two values.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">Figure 9.27(b) explains the formation of primary rainbow. We see that red light from drop 1 and violet light from drop 2 reach the observers eye. The violet from drop 1 and red light from drop 2 are directed at level above or below the observer. Thus the observer sees a rainbow with red colour on the top and violet on the bottom. Thus, the primary rainbow is a result of three-step process, that is, refraction, reflection and refraction.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">When light rays undergoes</span> <span class="char-style-override">two</span> <span class="char-style-override">internal reflections inside a raindrop, instead of</span> <span class="char-style-override">one</span> <span class="char-style-override">as in the primary rainbow, a secondary rainbow is formed as shown in Fig. 9.27(c). It is due to four-step process. The intensity of light is reduced at the second reflection and hence the secondary rainbow is fainter than the primary rainbow. Further, the order of the colours is reversed in it as is clear from Fig. 9.27(c).</span></p>

    <p class="subheading">9.8.2 Scattering of light</p>

    <p class="subheading"><br class="calibre5" /></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">As sunlight travels through the earth’s atmosphere, it gets</span> <span class="char-style-override">scattered</span> <span class="char-style-override">(changes its direction)</span> <span class="char-style-override">by the atmospheric particles. Light of shorter wavelengths is scattered much more than light of longer wavelengths.</span> <span class="char-style-override">(</span><span class="char-style-override">The amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. This is known as Rayleigh scattering). Hence, the bluish colour predominates in a clear sky, since blue has a shorter wave&shy; length than red and is scattered much more strongly. In fact, violet gets scattered even more than blue, having a shorter wavelength.<br class="calibre5" />
    But since our eyes are more sensitive to blue than violet, we see the sky blue.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">Large particles like dust and water droplets present in the atmosphere behave differently. The relevant quantity here is the relative size of the wavelength of light</span> <span class="char-style-override">λ</span><span class="char-style-override">, and the scatterer (of typical size, say</span><span class="char-style-override">, a</span><span class="char-style-override">). For</span> <span class="char-style-override">a</span> <span class="char-style-override">&lt;&lt; λ</span><span class="char-style-override">, one has Rayleigh scattering which is proportional to 1/</span><span class="char-style-override">λ</span><span class="char-style-override1">4</span><span class="char-style-override">. For</span> <span class="char-style-override">a</span> <span class="char-style-override">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="char-style-override">λ</span><span class="char-style-override">, i.e., large scattering objects (for example, raindrops, large dust or ice particles) this is not true; all wavelengths are scattered nearly equally. Thus, clouds which have droplets of water with</span> <span class="char-style-override">a</span> <span class="char-style-override">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="char-style-override">λ</span> <span class="char-style-override">are generally white.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">At sunset or sunrise, the sun’s rays have to pass through a larger distance in the atmosphere (Fig. 9.28). Most of the blue and other shorter wavelengths are removed by scattering. The least scattered light reaching our eyes, therefore, the sun looks reddish. This explains the reddish appearance of the sun and full moon near the horizon.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8">A number of optical devices and instruments have been designed utilising reflecting and refracting properties of mirrors, lenses and prisms. Periscope, kaleidoscope, binoculars, telescopes, microscopes are some examples of optical devices and instruments that are in common use. Our eye is, of course, one of the most important optical device the nature has endowed us with. Starting with the eye, we then go on to describe the principles of working of the microscope and the telescope.</p>

    <p class="subheading">9.9.1 The eye</p>

    <p class="subheading"><br class="calibre5" /></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">Figure 9.29 (a) shows the eye. Light enters the eye through a curved front surface, the cornea. It passes through the pupil which is the central hole in the iris. The size of the pupil can change under control of muscles. The light is further focussed by the eye lens on the retina. The retina is a film of nerve fibres covering the curved back surface of the eye. The retina contains rods and cones which sense light intensity and colour, respectively, and transmit electrical signals via the optic nerve to the brain which finally processes this information. The shape (curvature) and therefore the focal length of the lens can be modified somewhat by the ciliary muscles. For example, when the muscle is relaxed, the focal length is about 2.5 cm and objects at infinity are in sharp focus on the retina. When the object is brought closer to the eye, in order to maintain the same image-lens distance (</span><span class="char-style-override">≅</span> <span class="char-style-override">2.5 cm), the focal length of the eye lens becomes shorter by the action of the ciliary muscles. This property of the eye is called</span> <span class="char-style-override">accommodation</span><span class="char-style-override">. If the object is too close to the eye, the lens cannot curve enough to focus the image on to the retina, and the image is blurred. The closest distance for which the lens can focus light on the retina is called the</span> <span class="char-style-override">least distance of distinct vision</span><span class="char-style-override">, or the</span> <span class="char-style-override">near point</span><span class="char-style-override">. The standard value for normal vision is taken as 25 cm. (Often the near point is given the symbol D.) This distance increases with age, because of the decreasing effectiveness of the ciliary muscle and the loss of flexibility of the lens. The near point may be as close as about 7 to 8 cm in a child ten years of age, and may increase to as much as 200 cm at 60</span> <span class="char-style-override">years of age. Thus, if an elderly person tries to read a book at about 25 cm from the eye, the image appears blurred. This condition (defect of the eye) is called</span> <span class="char-style-override">presbyopia</span><span class="char-style-override">. It is corrected by using a converging lens for reading.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">Thus, our eyes are marvellous organs that have the capability to interpret incoming electromagnetic waves as images through a complex process. These are our greatest assets and we must take proper care to protect them. Imagine the world without a pair of functional eyes. Yet many amongst us bravely face this challenge by effectively overcoming their limitations to lead a normal life. They deserve our appreciation for their courage and conviction.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">In spite of all precautions and proactive action, our eyes may develop some defects due to various reasons. We shall restrict our discussion to some common optical defects of the eye. For example, the light from a distant object arriving at the eye-lens may get converged at a point in front of the retina. This type of defect is called</span> <span class="char-style-override">nearsightedness</span> <span class="char-style-override">or</span> <span class="char-style-override">myopi</span><span class="char-style-override">a</span><span class="char-style-override">.</span> <span class="char-style-override">This means that the eye is producing too much convergence in the incident beam. To compensate this, we interpose a concave lens between the eye and the object, with the diverging effect desired to get the image focussed on the retina [Fig. 9.29(b)].</span></p>

If a person with such a defect in eye-lens looks at a wire mesh or a grid of lines, focussing in either the vertical or the horizontal plane may not be as sharp as in the other plane. Astigmatism results in lines in one direction being well focussed while those in a perpendicular direction may appear distorted [Fig. 9.29(d)]. Astigmatism can be corrected by using a cylindrical lens of desired radius of curvature with an appropriately directed axis. This defect can occur along with myopia or hypermetropia.</span></p>

    <p class="subheading">9.9.2 The microscope</p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override"><br class="calibre5" />
    A simple magnifier or microscope is a converging lens of small focal length (Fig. 9.30). In order to use such a lens as a microscope, the lens is held near the object, one focal length away or less, and the eye is positioned close to the lens on the other side. The idea is to get an erect, magnified and virtual image of the object at a distance so that it can be viewed comfortably, i.e., at 25 cm or more. If the object is at a distance</span> <span class="char-style-override">f</span><span class="char-style-override">, the image is at infinity. However, if the object is at a distance slightly less than the focal length of the lens, the image is virtual and closer than infinity. Although the closest comfortable distance for viewing the image is when it is at the near point (distance</span> <span class="char-style-override"><br class="calibre5" />
    D</span> <span class="char-style-override">≅</span> <span class="char-style-override">25 cm), it causes some strain on the eye. Therefore, the image formed at infinity is often considered most suitable for viewing by the relaxed eye. We show both cases, the first in Fig. 9.30(a), and the second in Fig. 9.30(b) and (c).</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">The linear magnification</span> <span class="char-style-override">m</span><span class="char-style-override">, for the image formed at the near point</span> <span class="char-style-override">D</span><span class="char-style-override">, by a simple microscope can be obtained by using the relation</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">A simple microscope has a limited maximum magnification (</span><span class="char-style-override">≤</span> <span class="char-style-override">9) for realistic focal lengths.

This is known as a</span> <span class="char-style-override">compound microscope</span><span class="char-style-override">. A schematic diagram of a compound microscope is shown in Fig. 9.31. The lens nearest the object, called the</span> <span class="char-style-override">objective</span><span class="char-style-override">, forms a real, inverted, magnified image of the object. This serves as the object for the second lens, the</span> <span class="char-style-override">eyepiece</span><span class="char-style-override">, which functions essentially like a simple microscope or magnifier, produces the final image, which is enlarged and virtual. The first inverted image is thus near (at or within) the focal plane of the eyepiece, at a distance appropriate for final image formation at infinity, or a little closer for image formation at the near point. Clearly, the final image is inverted with respect to the original object.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override"><br class="calibre5" /></span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">The telescope is used to provide angular magnification of distant objects (Fig. 9.32). It also has an objective and an eyepiece. But here, the objective has a large focal length and a much larger aperture than the eyepiece. Light from a distant object enters the objective and a real image is formed in the tube at its second focal point. The eyepiece magnifies this image producing a final inverted image. The magnifying power</span> <span class="char-style-override">m</span> <span class="char-style-override">is the ratio of the angle</span> <span class="char-style-override">β</span> <span class="char-style-override">subtended at the eye by the final image to the angle</span> <span class="char-style-override">α</span> <span class="char-style-override">which the object subtends at the lens or the eye. Hence</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">In this case, the length of the telescope tube is</span> <span class="char-style-override">f</span><span class="char-style-override1">o</span> <span class="char-style-override">+ f</span><span class="char-style-override1">e</span><span class="char-style-override">.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">Terrestrial telescopes have, in addition, a pair of inverting lenses to make the final image erect. Refracting telescopes can be used both for terrestrial and astronomical observations. For example, consider a telescope whose objective has a focal length of 100 cm and the eyepiece a focal length of 1 cm. The magnifying power of this telescope is m = 100/1 = 100.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">Let us consider a pair of stars of actual separation 1</span><span class="char-style-override">′</span> <span class="char-style-override">(one minute of arc). The stars appear as though they are separated by an angle of 100 × 1</span><span class="char-style-override">′</span> <span class="char-style-override">= 100</span><span class="char-style-override">′</span> <span class="char-style-override">=1.67º.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">The main considerations with an astronomical telescope are its light gathering power and its resolution or resolving power. The former clearly depends on the area of the objective. With larger diameters, fainter objects can be observed. The resolving power, or the ability to observe two objects distinctly, which are in very nearly the same direction, also depends on the diameter of the objective. So, the desirable aim in optical telescopes is to make them with objective of large diameter. The largest lens objective in use has a diameter of 40 inch (~1.02 m). It is at the Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin, USA. Such big lenses tend to be very heavy and therefore, difficult to make and support by their edges. Further, it is rather difficult and expensive to make such large sized lenses which form images that are free from any kind of chromatic aberration and distortions.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">For these reasons, modern telescopes use a concave mirror rather than a lens for the objective. Telescopes with mirror objectives are called</span> <span class="char-style-override">reflecting</span> <span class="char-style-override">telescopes. They have several advantages. First, there is no chromatic aberration in a mirror. Second, if a parabolic reflecting surface is chosen, spherical aberration is also removed. Mechanical support is much less of a problem since a mirror weighs much less than a lens of equivalent optical quality, and can be supported over its entire back surface, not just over its rim. One obvious problem with a reflecting telescope is that the objective mirror focusses light inside the telescope tube. One must have an eyepiece and the observer right there, obstructing some light (depending on the size of the observer cage). This is what is done in the very large 200 inch (~5.08 m) diameters, Mt. Palomar telescope, California. The viewer sits near the focal point of the mirror, in a small cage. Another solution to the problem is to deflect the light being focussed by another mirror. One such arrangement using a convex</span> <span class="char-style-override">secondary mirror to focus the incident light, which now passes through a hole in the objective primary mirror, is shown in Fig. 9.33. This is</span> <span class="char-style-override">known as a</span> <span class="char-style-override">Cassegrain</span> <span class="char-style-override">telescope, after its inventor. It has the advantages of a large focal length in a short telescope. The largest telescope in India is in Kavalur, Tamil Nadu. It is a 2.34 m diameter reflecting telescope (Cassegrain). It was ground, polished, set up, and is being used by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore. The largest reflecting telescopes in the world are the pair of Keck telescopes in Hawaii, USA, with a reflector of 10 metre in diameter.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre19">Points to Ponder</b><br class="calibre5" /></p>

    <p class="calibre8"></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">1. The laws of reflection and refraction are true for all surfaces and pairs of media at the point of the incidence.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">2. The real image of an object placed between</span> <span class="char-style-override">f</span> <span class="char-style-override">and 2</span><span class="char-style-override">f</span> <span class="char-style-override">from a convex lens can be seen on a screen placed at the image location. If the screen is removed, is the image still there? This question puzzles many, because it is difficult to reconcile ourselves with an image suspended in air without a screen. But the image does exist. Rays from a given point on the object are converging to an image point in space and diverging away. The screen simply diffuses these rays, some of which reach our eye and we see the image. This can be seen by the images formed in air during a laser show.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">3. Image formation needs regular reflection/refraction. In principle, all rays from a given point should reach the same image point. This is why you do not see your image by an irregular reflecting object, say the page of a book.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">4. Thick lenses give coloured images due to dispersion. The variety in colour of objects we see around us is due to the constituent colours of the light incident on them. A monochromatic light may produce an entirely different perception about the colours on an object as seen in white light.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override">5. For a simple microscope, the angular size of the object equals the angular size of the image. Yet it offers magnification because we can keep the small object much closer to the eye than 25 cm and hence have it subtend a large angle. The image is at 25 cm which we can see. Without the microscope, you would need to keep the small object at 25 cm which would subtend a very small angle.</span></p>
