    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">The Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism and Hertz experiments on the generation and detection of electromagnetic waves in 1887 strongly established the wave nature of light. Towards the same period at the end of 19th century, experimental investigations on conduction of electricity (electric discharge) through gases at low pressure in a discharge tube led to many historic discoveries.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">The discovery of X-rays by Roentgen in 1895, and of electron by J. J. Thomson in 1897, were important milestones in the understanding of atomic structure. It was found that at sufficiently low pressure of about 0.001 mm of mercury column, a discharge took place between the two electrodes on applying the electric field to the gas in the discharge tube. A fluorescent glow appeared on the glass opposite to cathode. The colour of glow of the glass depended on the type of glass, it being yellowish-green for soda glass. The cause of this fluorescence was attributed to the radiation which appeared to be coming from the cathode. These</span> <span class="char-style-override1">cathode rays</span> <span class="char-style-override">were discovered, in 1870, by William Crookes who later, in 1879, suggested that these rays consisted of streams of fast moving negatively charged particles. The British physicist&nbsp;J. J. Thomson (185</span><span class="char-style-override">6</span><span class="char-style-override">-1940) confirmed this hypothesis. By applying mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields across the discharge tube, J. J. Thomson was the first to determine experimentally the speed and the specific charge [charge to mass ratio (</span><span class="char-style-override1">e</span><span class="char-style-override">/</span><span class="char-style-override1">m</span><span class="char-style-override">)] of the cathode ray</span> <span class="char-style-override">particles. They were found to travel with speeds ranging from about 0.1 to 0.2 times the speed of light (3 ×10</span><span class="char-style-override">8</span> <span class="char-style-override">m/s). The presently accepted value of</span> <span class="char-style-override1">e</span><span class="char-style-override">/</span><span class="char-style-override1">m</span> <span class="char-style-override">is 1.76 × 10&shy;</span><span class="char-style-override">11</span> <span class="char-style-override">C/kg. Further, the value of</span> <span class="char-style-override1">e</span><span class="char-style-override">/</span><span class="char-style-override1">m</span> <span class="char-style-override">was found to be independent of the nature of the material/metal used as the cathode (emitter), or the gas introduced in the discharge tube. This observation suggested the universality of the cathode ray particles.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">Around the same time, in 1887, it was found that certain metals, when irradiated by ultraviolet light, emitted negatively charged particles having small</span> <span class="char-style-override">speeds. Also, certain metals when heated to a high temperature were found to emit negatively charged particles. The value of</span> <span class="char-style-override1">e</span><span class="char-style-override">/</span><span class="char-style-override1">m</span> <span class="char-style-override">of these particles was found to be the same as that for cathode ray particles. These observations thus established that all these particles, although produced under different conditions, were identical in nature. J. J. Thomson, in 1897, named these particles as</span> <span class="char-style-override1">electrons</span><span class="char-style-override">, and suggested that they were fundamental, universal constituents of matter. For his epoch-making discovery of electron, through his theoretical and experimental investigations on conduction of electricity by gasses, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906. In 1913, the American physicist R. A. Millikan (186</span><span class="char-style-override">8</span><span class="char-style-override">-1953) performed the pioneering oil-drop experiment for the precise measurement of the charge on an electron. He found that the charge on an oil-droplet was always an integral multiple of an elementary charge, 1.602 × 1</span><span class="char-style-override">0</span><span class="char-style-override">&ndash;19</span> <span class="char-style-override">C. Millikan’s experiment established that</span> <span class="char-style-override1">electric charge is quantised</span><span class="char-style-override">.</span> <span class="char-style-override">From the values of charge (</span><span class="char-style-override1">e</span><span class="char-style-override">) and specific charge</span> <span class="char-style-override"><br class="calibre4" />

    <h1 class="calibre5"><b class="calibre7">11.2&nbsp;ELECTRON EMISSION</b></h1>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">We know that metals have free electrons (negatively charged particles) that are responsible for their conductivity. However, the free electrons cannot normally escape out of the metal surface. If an electron attempts to come out of the metal, the metal surface acquires a positive charge and pulls the electron back to the metal. The free electron is thus held inside the metal surface by the attractive forces of the ions. Consequently, the electron can come out of the metal surface only if it has got sufficient energy to overcome the attractive pull. A certain minimum amount of energy is required to be given to an electron to pull it out from the surface of the metal. This minimum energy</span> <span class="char-style-override">required by an electron to escape from the metal surface is called the</span> <span class="char-style-override1">work function</span> <span class="char-style-override">of the metal. It is generally denoted by</span> <span class="char-style-override">φ</span><span class="char-style-override2">0</span> <span class="char-style-override">and measured in e</span><span class="char-style-override">v</span> <span class="char-style-override">(electron volt). One electron volt is the energy gained by an electron when it has been accelerated</span> <span class="char-style-override">by a potential difference of 1 volt, so that 1 eV = 1.602 ×1</span><span class="char-style-override">0</span><sup class="calibre8">&ndash;19</sup> <span class="char-style-override">J.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">This unit of energy is commonly used in atomic and nuclear physics. The work function (</span><span class="char-style-override">φ</span><span class="char-style-override2">0</span><span class="char-style-override">) depends on the properties of the metal and the nature of its surface. The values of work function of some metals are given in Table 11.1. These values are approximate as they are very sensitive to surface impurities.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">Note from Table 11.1 that the work function of platinum is the highest (</span><span class="char-style-override">φ</span><span class="char-style-override2">0</span> <span class="char-style-override">= 5.65 eV) while it is the lowest (</span><span class="char-style-override">φ</span><span class="char-style-override2">0</span> <span class="char-style-override">= 2.14 eV) for caesium.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">The phenomenon of photoelectric emission was discovered in 1887 by Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894), during his electromagnetic wave experiments. In his experimental investigation on the production of electromagnetic waves by means of a spark discharge, Hertz observed that high voltage sparks across the detector loop were enhanced when the emitter plate was illuminated by ultraviolet light from an arc lamp.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">Light shining on the metal surface somehow facilitated the escape of free, charged particles which we now know as electrons. When light falls on a metal surface, some electrons near the surface absorb enough energy from the incident radiation to overcome the attraction of the positive ions in the material of the surface. After gaining sufficient energy from the incident light, the electrons escape from the surface of the metal into the surrounding space.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">Wilhelm Hallwachs and Philipp Lenard investigated the phenomenon of photoelectric emission in detail during 1886-1902.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">Lenard (1862-1947) observed that when ultraviolet radiations were allowed to fall on the emitter plate of an evacuated glass tube enclosing two electrodes (metal plates), current flows in the circuit (Fig. 11.1). As soon as the ultraviolet radiations were stopped, the current flow also</span> <span class="char-style-override">stopped. These observations indicate that when ultraviolet radiations fall on the emitter plate C, electrons are ejected from it which are attracted towards the positive, collector plate A by the electric field. The electrons flow through the evacuated glass tube, resulting in the current flow. Thus, light falling on the surface of the emitter causes current in the external circuit. Hallwachs and Lenard studied how this photo current varied with collector plate potential, and with frequency and intensity of incident light.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">Hallwachs, in 1888, undertook the study further and connected a negatively charged zinc plate to an electroscope. He observed that the zinc plate lost its charge when it was illuminated by ultraviolet light. Further, the uncharged zinc plate became positively charged when it was irradiated by ultraviolet light. Positive charge on a positively charged zinc plate was found to be further enhanced when it was illuminated by ultraviolet light. From these observations he concluded that negatively charged particles were emitted from the zinc plate under the action of ultraviolet light.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">After the discovery of the electron in 1897, it became evident that the incident light causes electrons to be emitted from the emitter plate. Due to negative charge, the emitted electrons are pushed towards the collector plate by the electric field. Hallwachs and Lenard also observed that when ultraviolet light fell on the emitter plate, no electrons were emitted at all when the frequency of the incident light was smaller than a certain minimum value, called the</span> <span class="char-style-override1">threshold frequency</span><span class="char-style-override">. This minimum frequency depends on the nature of the material of the emitter plate.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">It was found that certain metals like zinc, cadmium, magnesium, etc., responded only to ultraviolet light, having short wavelength, to cause electron emission from the surface.

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">Figure 11.1 depicts a schematic view of the arrangement used for the experimental study of the photoelectric effect. It consists of an evacuated glass/quartz tube having a photosensitive plate C and another metal&nbsp;plate A. Monochromatic light from the source S of sufficiently short wavelength passes through the window W and falls on the photosensitive plate C (emitter). A transparent quartz window is sealed on to the glass</span> <span class="char-style-override">tube, which permits ultraviolet radiation to pass through it and irradiate</span> <span class="char-style-override">the photosensitive plate C. The electrons are emitted by the plate C and are collected by the plate A (collector), by the electric field created by the battery. The battery maintains the potential difference between the plates C and A, that can be varied. The polarity of the plates C and A can be reversed by a commutator. Thus, the plate A can be maintained at a desired positive or negative potential with respect to emitter C. When the collector plate A is positive with respect to the emitter plate C, the electrons are</span> <span class="char-style-override">attracted to it.

    <div class="calibre4">
      <br class="calibre4" />
    </div>

    <div class="calibre4">
      The wave nature of light was well established by the end of the nineteenth century. The phenomena of interference, diffraction and polarisation were explained in a natural and satisfactory way by the wave picture of light. According to this picture, light is an electromagnetic wave consisting of electric and magnetic fields with continuous distribution of energy over the region of space over which the wave is extended. Let us now see if this wave picture of light can explain the observations on photoelectric emission given in the previous section.<br class="calibre4" />
    </div>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">According to the wave picture of</span> <span class="char-style-override">light, the free electrons at the surface of the metal (over which the beam of radiation falls) absorb the radiant energy continuously. The greater the intensity of radiation, the greater are the amplitude of electric and magnetic fields. Consequently, the greater the intensity, the greater should be the energy absorbed by each electron. In this picture, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons on the surface is then expected to increase with increase in intensity. Also, no matter what the frequency of radiation is, a sufficiently intense beam of radiation (over sufficient time) should be able to impart enough energy to the electrons, so that they exceed the minimum energy needed to escape from the metal surface . A threshold frequency, therefore, should not exist. These expectations of the wave theory directly contradict observations (i), (ii) and (iii) given at the end of sub-section 11.4.3.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">Further, we should note that in the wave picture, the absorption of energy by electron takes place continuously over the entire<br class="calibre4" />
    wavefront of the radiation. Since a large number of electrons absorb energy, the energy absorbed per electron per unit time turns out to be small. Explicit calculations estimate that it can take hours or more for a single electron to pick up sufficient energy to overcome the work function and come out of the metal. This conclusion is again in striking contrast to observation (iv) that the photoelectric emission is instantaneous. In short, the wave picture is unable to explain the most basic features of photoelectric emission.</span></p>

In 1905, he published three path-breaking papers. In the first paper, he introduced the notion of light quanta (now called photons) and used it to explain the features of photoelectric effect. In the second paper, he developed a theory of Brownian motion, confirmed experimentally a few years later and provided a convincing evidence of the atomic picture of matter. The third paper gave birth to the special theory of relativity. In 1916, he published the general theory of relativity. Some of Einstein’s most significant later contributions are: the notion of stimulated emission introduced in an alternative derivation of Planck’s blackbody radiation law, static model of the universe which started modern cosmology, quantum statistics of a gas of massive bosons, and a critical analysis of the foundations of quantum mechanics. In 1921, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for his contribution to theoretical physics and the photoelectric effect.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-US">The dual (wave-particle) nature of light (electromagnetic radiation, in general) comes out clearly from what we have learnt in this and the preceding chapters. The wave nature of light shows up in the phenomena of interference, diffraction and polarisation. On the other hand, in photoelectric effect and Compton effect which involve energy and momentum transfer, radiation behaves as if it is made up of a bunch of particles &ndash; the photons. Whether a particle or wave description is best suited for understanding an experiment depends on the nature of the experiment. For example, in the familiar phenomenon of seeing an object by our eye, both descriptions are important. The gathering and focussing mechanism of light by the eye-lens is well described in the wave picture. But its absorption by the rods and cones (of the retina) requires the photon picture of light.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-US">A natural question arises: If radiation has a dual (wave-particle) nature, might not the particles of nature (the electrons, protons, etc.) also exhibit wave-like characte</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-US">r</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-US">? In 1924, the French physicist Louis Victor de Broglie (pronounced as de Broy) (1892-1987) put forward the bold hypothesis that moving particles of matter should display wave-like properties under suitable conditions. He reasoned that nature was symmetrical and that the two basic physical entities &ndash; matter and energy, must have symmetrical character. If radiation shows dual aspects, so should matter.

It is a device whose electrical properties are affected by light. It is also sometimes called an electric eye. A photocell consists of a semi-cylindrical photo-sensitive metal plate C (emitter) and a wire loop A (collector) supported in an evacuated glass or quartz bulb. It is connected to the external circuit having a high-tension battery B and microammeter (</span><span class="char-style-override">µ</span><span class="char-style-override">A) as shown in the Figure. Sometimes, instead of the plate C, a thin layer of photosensitive material is pasted on the inside of the bulb. A part of the bulb is left clean for the light to enter it.</span></p>

      <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">A photocell converts a change in intensity of illumination into a change in photocurrent. This current can be used to operate control systems and in light measuring devices. A photocell of lead sulphide sensitive to infrared radiation is used in electronic ignition circuits.</span></p>

      <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">In scientific work, photo cells are used whenever it is necessary to measure the intensity of light. Light meters in photographic cameras make use of photo cells to measure the intensity of incident light. The photocells, inserted in the door light electric circuit, are used as automatic door opener. A person approaching a doorway may interrupt a light beam which is incident on a photocell. The abrupt change in photocurrent may be used to start a motor which opens the door or rings an alarm. They are used in the control of a counting device which records every interruption of the light beam caused by a person or object passing across the beam. So photocells help count the persons entering an auditorium, provided they enter the hall one by one. They are used for detection of traffic law defaulters: an alarm may be sounded whenever a beam of</span> <span class="char-style-override1">(invisible)</span> <span class="char-style-override">radiation is intercepted.</span></p>

      <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">In burglar alarm, (invisible) ultraviolet light is continuously made to fall on a photocell installed at the doorway. A person entering the door interrupts the beam falling on the photocell. The abrupt change in photocurrent is used to start an electric bell ringing. In fire alarm, a number of photocells are installed at suitable places in a building. In the event of breaking out of fire, light radiations fall upon the photocell. This completes the electric circuit through an electric bell or a siren which starts operating as a warning signal.</span></p>

The great founders of quantum mechanics</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-US">(</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-US">Niels Bohr, Albert Einstein, and many others) struggled with this and related concepts for long. Still the deep physical interpretation of quantum mechanics continues to be an area of active research. Despite this, the concept of matter wave has been mathematically introduced in modern quantum mechanics with great success. An important milestone in this connection was when Max Born (1882-1970) suggested a probability interpretation to the matter wave amplitude.

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">The wave nature of electrons was first experimentally verified by C.J. Davisson and L.H. Germer in 1927 and independently by G.P. Thomson, in 1928, who observed diffraction effects with beams of electrons scattered by crystals. Davisson and Thomson shared the Nobel Prize in 1937 for their experimental discovery of diffraction of electrons by crystals.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">The experimental arrange-ment used by Davisson and Germer is schematically shown in Fig. 11.7. It consists of an electron gun which comprises of a tungsten filament F, coated with barium oxide and heated by a low voltage power supply (L.T. or battery). Electrons emitted by the filament are accelerated to a desired velocity by applying suitable potential/voltage from a high voltage power supply</span> <span class="char-style-override">(</span><span class="char-style-override">H.T. or battery). They are made to pass through a cylinder with fine holes along its axis, producing a fine collimated beam. The beam is made to fall on the surface of a nickel crystal. The electrons are scattered in all directions by the atoms of the crystal. The intensity of the electron beam, scattered in a given direction, is measured by the electron detector (collector). The detector can be moved on a circular scale and is connected to a sensitive galvanometer, which records the current. The deflection of the galvanometer is proportional to the intensity of the electron beam entering the collector. The apparatus is enclosed in an evacuated chamber. By moving the detector on the circular scale at different positions, the intensity of the scattered electron beam is measured for different values of angle of scattering</span> <span class="char-style-override">θ</span> <span class="char-style-override">which is the angle between the incident and the scattered electron beams. The variation of the intensity (</span><span class="char-style-override1">I</span><span class="char-style-override">) of the scattered electrons with the angle of scattering</span> <span class="char-style-override">θ</span> <span class="char-style-override">is obtained for different accelerating voltages.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">The appearance of the peak in a particular direction is due to the constructive interference of electrons scattered from different layers of the regularly spaced atoms of the crystals.

More recently, in 1989, the wave nature of a beam of electrons was experimentally demonstrated in a double-slit experiment, similar to that used for the wave nature of light. Also, in an experiment in 1994, interference fringes were obtained with the beams of iodine molecules, which are about a million times more massive than electrons.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">The de Broglie hypothesis has been basic to the development of modern quantum mechanics. It has also led to the field of electron optics. The wave properties of electrons have been utilised in the design of electron microscope which is a great improvement, with higher resolution, over the optical microscope.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">Photoelectric effect involves conversion of light energy into electrical energy. It follows the law of conservation of energy. The photoelectric emission is an instantaneous process and possesses certain special features.</span></p>

For a given frequency of incident light, it is independent of its intensity. The stopping potential is directly related to the maximum kinetic energy of electrons emitted:</span> <span class="char-style-override"><br class="calibre4" />

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">This photoelectric equation explains all the features of the photoelectric effect. Millikan’s first precise measurements confirmed the Einstein’s photoelectric equation and obtained an accurate value of Planck’s constant</span> <span class="char-style-override">h</span><span class="char-style-override">. This led to the acceptance of particle or photon description (nature) of electromagnetic radiation, introduced by Einstein.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">8. Radiation has dual nature: wave and particle. The nature of experiment determines whether a wave or particle description is best suited for understanding the experimental result. Reasoning that radiation and matter should be symmetrical in nature, Louis Victor de Broglie attributed a wave-like character to matter (material particles). The waves associated with the moving material particles are called matter waves or de Broglie waves.</span></p>

The de Broglie wavelength is independent of the charge and nature of the material particle. It is significantly measurable (of the order of the atomic-planes spacing in crystals) only in case of sub-atomic particles like electrons, protons, etc. (due to smallness of their masses and hence, momenta). However, it is indeed very small, quite beyond measurement, in case of macroscopic objects, commonly encountered in everyday life.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername"><span class="char-style-override">10. Electron diffraction experiments by Davisson and Germer, and by G. P.

      <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override6" lang="en-US">1. Free electrons in a metal are free in the sense that they move inside the metal in a constant potential (This is only an approximation). They are not free to move out of the metal. They need additional energy to get out of the metal.</span></p>

      <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override6" lang="en-US">2. Free electrons in a metal do not all have the same energy. Like molecules in a gas jar, the electrons have a certain energy distribution at a given temperature. This distribution is different from the usual Maxwell’s distribution that you have learnt in the study of kinetic theory of gases. You will learn about it in later courses, but the difference has to do with the fact that electrons obey Pauli’s exclusion principle.</span></p>

      <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override6" lang="en-US">3. Because of the energy distribution of free electrons in a metal, the energy required by an electron to come out of the metal is different for different electrons. Electrons with higher energy require less additional energy to come out of the metal than those with lower energies. Work function is the least energy required by an electron to come out of the metal.</span></p>

It is therefore appropriate to summarize some observations about light that were known in the seventeenth century.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">The properties of light known at that time included (a) rectilinear propagation of light, (b) reflection from plane and curved surfaces, (c) refraction at the boundary of two media, (d) dispersion into various colours, (e) high speed. Appropriate laws were formulated for the first four phenomena. For example, Snell formulated his laws of refraction in 1621. Several scientists right from the days of Galileo had tried to measure the speed of light. But they had not been able to do so. They had only concluded that it was higher than the limit of their measurement.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">Two models of light were also proposed in the seventeenth century. Descartes, in early decades of seventeenth century, proposed that light consists of particles, while Huygens, around 1650-60, proposed that light consists of waves. Descartes</span><span class="char-style-override">′</span> <span class="char-style-override">proposal was merely a philosophical model, devoid of any experiments or scientific arguments. Newton soon after, around 1660-70, extended Descartes</span><span class="char-style-override">′</span> <span class="char-style-override">particle model, known as</span> <span class="char-style-override">corpuscular theory</span><span class="char-style-override">, built it up as a scientific theory, and explained various known properties with it. These models, light as waves and as particles, in a sense, are quite opposite of each other. But both models could explain all the known properties of light. There was nothing to choose between them.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">The history of the development of these models over the next few centuries is interesting. Bartholinus, in 1669, discovered double refraction of light in some crystals, and Huygens, in 1678, was quick to explain it on the basis of his wave theory of light. In spite of this, for over one hundred years, Newton’s particle model was firmly believed and preferred over the wave model. This was partly because of its simplicity and partly because of Newton’s influence on contemporary physics.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">Then in 1801, Young performed his double-slit experiment and observed interference fringes. This phenomenon could be explained only by wave theory. It was realized that diffraction was also another phenomenon which could be explained only by wave theory. In fact, it was a natural consequence of Huygens idea of secondary wavelets emanating from every point in the path of light. These experiments could not be explained by assuming that light consists of particles. Another phenomenon of polarisation was discovered around 1810, and this too could be naturally explained by the wave theory. Thus wave theory of Huygens came to the forefront and Newton’s particle theory went into the background. This situation again continued for almost a century.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">Better experiments were performed in the nineteenth century to determine the speed of light. With more accurate experiments, a value of 3×10</span><span class="char-style-override6">8</span> <span class="char-style-override">m/s for speed of light in vacuum was arrived at. Around 1860, Maxwell proposed his equations of electromagnetism and it was realized that</span> <span class="char-style-override">all</span> <span class="char-style-override">electromagnetic phenomena known at that time could be explained by Maxwell’s four equations. Soon Maxwell showed that electric and magnetic fields could propagate through empty space (vacuum) in the form of electromagnetic waves. He calculated the speed of these waves and arrived at a theoretical value of 2.998×10</span><span class="char-style-override6">8</span> <span class="char-style-override">m/s. The close agreement of this value with the experimental value suggested that light consists of electromagnetic waves. In 1887 Hertz demonstrated the generation and detection of such waves. This established the wave theory of light on a firm footing. We might say that while eighteenth century belonged to the particle model, the nineteenth century belonged to the wave model of light.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">Vast amounts of experiments were done during the period 1850-1900 on heat and related phenomena, an altogether different area of physics. Theories and models like kinetic theory and thermodynamics were developed which quite successfully explained the various phenomena, except one.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">Every body at any temperature emits radiation of all wavelengths. It also absorbs radiation falling on it. A body which absorbs all the radiation falling on it is called a</span> <span class="char-style-override">black body</span><span class="char-style-override">. It is an ideal concept in physics, like concepts of a point mass or uniform motion. A graph of the intensity of radiation emitted by a body versus wavelength is called the</span> <span class="char-style-override">black body spectrum</span><span class="char-style-override">. No theory in those days could explain the complete black body spectrum!</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">In 1900, Planck hit upon a novel idea. If we assume, he said, that radiation is emitted in packets of energy instead of continuously as in a wave, then we can explain the black body spectrum. Planck himself regarded these quanta, or packets, as a property of emission and absorption, rather than that of light. He derived a formula which agreed with the entire spectrum. This was a confusing mixture of wave and particle pictures &ndash; radiation is emitted as a particle, it travels as a wave, and is again absorbed as a particle! Moreover, this put physicists in a dilemma. Should we again accept the particle picture of light just to explain one phenomenon? Then what happens to the phenomena of interference and diffraction which cannot be explained by the particle model?</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">But soon in 1905, Einstein explained the photoelectric effect by assuming the particle picture of light. In 1907, Debye explained the low temperature specific heats of solids by using the particle picture for lattice vibrations in a crystalline solid. Both these phenomena belonging to widely diverse areas of physics could be explained only by the particle model and not by the wave model. In 1923, Compton’s x-ray scattering experiments from atoms also went in favour of the particle picture. This increased the dilemma further.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">Thus by 1923, physicists faced with the following situation. (a) There were some phenomena like rectilinear propagation, reflection, refraction, which could be explained by either particle model or by wave model. (b) There were some phenomena such as diffraction and interference which could be explained only by the wave model but</span> <span class="char-style-override">not</span> <span class="char-style-override">by the particle model. (c) There were some phenomena such as black body radiation, photoelectric effect, and Compton scattering which could be explained only by the particle model but</span> <span class="char-style-override">not</span> <span class="char-style-override">by the wave model. Somebody in those days aptly remarked that light behaves as a particle on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and as a wave on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and we don’t talk of light on Sundays!</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">In 1924, de Broglie proposed his theory of wave-particle duality in which he said that not only photons of light but also ‘particles’ of matter such as electrons and atoms possess a dual character, sometimes behaving like a particle and sometimes as a wave. He gave a formula connecting their mass, velocity, momentum (particle characteristics), with their wavelength and frequency (wave characteristics)! In 1927 Thomson, and Davisson and Germer, in separate experiments, showed that electrons did behave like waves with a wavelength which agreed with that given by de Broglie’s formula. Their experiment was on diffraction of electrons through crystalline solids, in which the regular arrangement of atoms acted like a grating. Very soon, diffraction experiments with other ‘particles’ such as neutrons and protons were performed and these too confirmed with de Broglie’s formula. This confirmed wave-particle duality as an established principle of physics. Here was a principle, physicists thought, which explained all the phenomena mentioned above not only for light but also for the so-called particles.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">But there was no basic theoretical foundation for wave-particle duality. De Broglie’s proposal was merely a qualitative argument based on symmetry of nature. Wave-particle duality was at best a principle, not an outcome of a sound fundamental theory. It is true that all experiments whatever agreed with de Broglie formula. But physics does not work that way. On the one hand, it needs experimental confirmation, while on the other hand, it also needs sound theoretical basis for the models proposed. This was developed over the next two decades. Dirac developed his theory of radiation in about 1928, and Heisenberg and Pauli gave it a firm footing by 1930. Tomonaga, Schwinger, and Feynman, in late 1940s, produced further refinements and cleared the theory of inconsistencies which were noticed. All these theories mainly put wave-particle duality on a theoretical footing.</span></p>

    <p class="chaptername" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override">Although the story continues, it grows more and more complex and beyond the scope of this note. But we have here the essential structure of what happened, and let us be satisfied with it at the moment. Now it is regarded as a natural consequence of present theories of physics that electromagnetic radiation as well as particles of matter exhibit both wave and particle properties in different experiments, and sometimes even in the different parts of the same experiment.</span></p>
