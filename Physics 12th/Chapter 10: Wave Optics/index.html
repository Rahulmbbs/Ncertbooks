    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">In 1637 Descartes gave the corpuscular model of light and derived Snell’s law. It explained the laws of reflection and refraction of light at an interface. The corpuscular model predicted that if the ray of light (on refraction) bends towards the normal then the speed of light would be greater in the second medium. This corpuscular model of light was further developed by Isaac Newton in his famous book entitled</span> <span class="char-style-override">OPTICKS</span> <span class="char-style-override">and because of the tremendous popularity of this book, the corpuscular model is very often attributed to Newton.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">In 1678, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens put forward the wave theory of light &ndash; it is this wave model of light that we will discuss in this chapter. As we will see, the wave model could satisfactorily explain the phenomena of reflection and refraction; however, it predicted that on refraction if the wave bends towards the normal then the speed of light would be less in the second medium. This is in contradiction to the prediction made by using the corpuscular model of light. It was much later confirmed by experiments where it was shown that the speed of light in water is less than the speed in air confirming the prediction of the wave model; Foucault carried out this experiment in 1850.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The wave theory was not readily accepted primarily because of Newton’s authority and also because light could travel through vacuum</span> <span class="char-style-override">and it was felt that a wave would always require a medium to propagate from one point to the other. However, when Thomas Young performed</span> <span class="char-style-override">his famous interference experiment in 1801, it was firmly established that light is indeed a wave phenomenon. The wavelength of visible light was measured and found to be extremely small; for example, the wavelength of yellow light is about 0.5</span> <span class="char-style-override">µ</span><span class="char-style-override">m. Because of the smallness of the wavelength of visible light (in comparison to the dimensions of typical mirrors and lenses), light can be assumed to approximately travel in straight lines. This is the field of geometrical optics, which we had discussed in the previous chapter. Indeed, the branch of optics in which one completely neglects the finiteness of the wavelength is called geometrical optics and a ray is defined as the path of energy propagation in the limit of wavelength tending to zero.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">After the interference experiment of Young in 1801, for the next 40 years or so, many experiments were carried out involving the interference and diffraction of lightwaves; these experiments could only be satisfactorily explained by assuming a wave model of light. Thus, around the middle of the nineteenth century, the wave theory seemed to be very well established. The only major difficulty was that since it was thought that a wave required a medium for its propagation, how could light waves propagate through vacuum. This was explained when Maxwell put forward his famous electromagnetic theory of light. Maxwell had developed a set of equations describing the laws of electricity and magnetism and using these equations he derived what is known as the wave equation from which he</span> <span class="char-style-override">predicted</span> <span class="char-style-override">the existence of electromagnetic waves</span><span class="char-style-override1">*</span><span class="char-style-override">. From the wave equation, Maxwell could calculate the speed of electromagnetic waves in free space and he found that the theoretical value was very close to the measured value of speed of light. From this, he propounded that</span> <span class="char-style-override">light must be an electromagnetic wave</span><span class="char-style-override">. Thus, according to Maxwell, light waves are associated with changing electric and magnetic fields; changing electric field produces a time and space varying magnetic field and a changing magnetic field produces a time and space varying electric field. The changing electric and magnetic fields result in the propagation of electromagnetic waves (or light</span> <span class="char-style-override">waves) even in vacuum.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">In this chapter we will first discuss the original formulation of the</span> <span class="char-style-override">Huygens principle</span> <span class="char-style-override">and derive the laws of reflection and refraction. In Sections 10.4 and 10.5, we will discuss the phenomenon of interference which is based on the principle of superposition. In Section 10.6 we will discuss the phenomenon of diffraction which is based on Huygens-Fresnel principle. Finally in Section 10.7 we will discuss the phenomenon of polarisation which is based on the fact that the light waves are</span> <span class="char-style-override">transverse electromagnetic waves</span><span class="char-style-override">.</span></p>

    <div class="calibre6">
      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override2">*</span> <span class="char-style-override">Maxwell had predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves around 1855; it was much later (around 1890) that Heinrich Hertz produced radiowaves in the laboratory. J.C. Bose and G. Marconi made practical applications of the</span> <span class="char-style-override">Hertzian waves</span></p>

      <p class="box_heading">Does light travel in a straight line?</p>

      <p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="normal">Light travels in a straight line in Class VI; it does not do so in Class XII and beyond! Surprised, aren’t you?</p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">In school, you are shown an experiment in which you take three cardboards with pinholes in them, place a candle on one side and look from the other side. If the flame of the candle and the three pinholes are in a straight line, you can see the candle. Even if one of them is displaced a little, you cannot see the candle.</span> <span class="char-style-override">This proves</span><span class="char-style-override">, so your teacher says,</span> <span class="char-style-override">that light travels in a straight line</span><span class="char-style-override3">.</span></p>

      <p class="normal">In the present book, there are two consecutive chapters, one on ray optics and the other on wave optics. Ray optics is based on rectilinear propagation of light, and deals with mirrors, lenses, reflection, refraction, etc. Then you come to the chapter on wave optics, and you are told that light travels as a wave, that it can bend around objects, it can diffract and interfere, etc.</p>

      <p class="normal">In optical region, light has a wavelength of about half a micrometre. If it encounters an obstacle of about this size, it can bend around it and can be seen on the other side. Thus a micrometre size obstacle will not be able to stop a light ray. If the obstacle is much larger, however, light will not be able to bend to that extent, and will not be seen on the other side.</p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">This is a property of a wave in general, and can be seen in sound waves too. The sound wave of our speech has a wavelength of about 5</span><span class="char-style-override">0</span><span class="char-style-override">cm to 1 m. If it meets an obstacle of the size of a few metres, it bends around it and reaches points behind the obstacle. But when it comes across a larger obstacle of a few hundred metres, such as a hillock, most of it is reflected and is heard as an echo.</span></p>

      <p class="normal">Then what about the primary school experiment? What happens there is that when we move any cardboard, the displacement is of the order of a few millimetres, which is much larger than the wavelength of light. Hence the candle cannot be seen. If we are able to move one of the cardboards by a micrometer or less, light will be able to diffract, and the candle will still be seen.</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">We would first define a wavefront: when we drop a small stone on a calm pool of water, waves spread out from the point of impact. Every point on the surface starts oscillating with time. At any instant, a photograph of the surface would show circular rings on which the disturbance is maximum. Clearly, all points on such a circle are oscillating in phase because they are at the same distance from the source. Such a locus of points, which oscillate in phase is called a</span> <span class="char-style-override">wavefron</span><span class="char-style-override">t</span><span class="char-style-override">;</span> <span class="char-style-override">thus</span> <span class="char-style-override">a wavefront is defined as a surface of constant phase</span><span class="char-style-override">. The speed with which the wavefront moves outwards from the source is called the speed of the wave. The energy of the wave travels in a direction perpendicular to the wavefront.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">If we have a point source emitting waves uniformly in all directions, then the locus of points which have the same amplitude and vibrate in the same phase are spheres and we have what is known as a</span> <span class="char-style-override">spherical wave</span> <span class="char-style-override">as shown in Fig. 10.1(a). At a large distance from the source, a small portion of the sphere can be considered as a plane and we have what is known as a</span> <span class="char-style-override">plane wave</span> <span class="char-style-override">[Fig. 10.1(b)].</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Once we have the laws of reflection and refraction, the behaviour of prisms, lenses, and mirrors can be understood. These phenomena were discussed in detail in Chapter 9 on the basis of rectilinear propagation of light. Here we just describe the behaviour of the wavefronts as they undergo reflection or refraction. In Fig. 10.7(a) we consider a plane wave passing through a thin prism. Clearly, since the speed of light waves is less in glass, the lower portion of the incoming wavefront (which travels through the greatest thickness of glass) will get delayed resulting in a tilt in the emerging wavefront as shown in the figure. In Fig. 10.7(b) we consider a plane wave incident on a thin convex lens; the central part of the incident plane wave traverses the thickest portion of the lens and is delayed the most. The emerging wavefront has a depression at the centre and therefore the wavefront becomes spherical and converges to the point F which is known as the</span> <span class="char-style-override">focus</span><span class="char-style-override">. In Fig. 10.7(c) a plane wave is incident on a concave mirror and on reflection we have a spherical wave converging to the focal point F. In a similar manner, we can understand refraction and reflection by concave lenses and convex mirrors.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">From the above discussion it follows that the total time taken from a point on the object to the corresponding point on the image is the same measured along any ray. For example, when a convex lens focusses light to form a real image, although the ray going through the centre traverses a shorter path, but because of the slower speed in glass, the time taken is the same as for rays travelling near the edge of the lens.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">We should mention here that one should be careful in constructing the wavefronts if the source (or the observer) is moving. For example, if there is no medium and the source moves away from the observer, then later wavefronts have to travel a greater distance to reach the observer and hence take a longer time. The time taken between the arrival of two successive wavefronts is hence longer at the observer than it is at the source. Thus, when the source moves away from the observer the frequency as measured by the source will be smaller. This is known as the</span> <span class="char-style-override">Doppler effect</span><span class="char-style-override">. Astronomers call the increase in wavelength due to doppler effect as</span> <span class="char-style-override">red shift</span> <span class="char-style-override">since a wavelength in the middle of the visible region of the spectrum moves towards the red end of the spectrum.

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">We will now discuss interference using light waves. If we use two sodium lamps illuminating two pinholes (Fig. 10.11) we will not observe any interference fringes. This is because of the fact that the light wave emitted from an ordinary source (like a sodium lamp) undergoes abrupt phase changes in times of the order of 10</span><span class="char-style-override">&ndash;10</span> <span class="char-style-override">seconds. Thus the light waves coming out from two independent sources of light will not have any fixed phase relationship and would be incoherent, when this happens, as discussed in the previous section, the intensities on the screen will add up.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The wave nature of light was demonstrated convincingly for the first time in 1801 by Thomas Young by a wonderfully simple experiment. He let a ray of sunlight into a dark room, placed a dark screen in front of it, pierced with two small pinholes, and beyond this, at some distance, a white screen. He then saw two darkish lines at both sides of a bright line, which gave him sufficient encouragement to repeat the experiment, this time with spirit flame as light source, with a little salt in it to produce the bright yellow sodium light. This time he saw a number of dark lines, regularly spaced; the first clear proof that light added to light can produce darkness. This phenomenon is called interference. Thomas Young had expected it because he believed in the wave theory of light.</span></p>

    <h1 class="calibre7">10.6 DIFFRACTION</h1>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">If we look clearly at the shadow cast by an opaque object, close to the region of geometrical shadow, there are alternate dark and bright regions just like in interference. This happens due to the phenomenon of diffraction. Diffraction is a general characteristic exhibited by all types of waves, be it sound waves, light waves, water waves or matter waves. Since the wavelength of light is much smaller than the dimensions of most obstacles; we do not encounter diffraction effects of light in everyday observations. However, the finite resolution of our eye or of optical</span> <span class="char-style-override">instruments such as telescopes or microscopes is limited due to the phenomenon of diffraction. Indeed the colours that you see when a CD is viewed is due to diffraction effects. We will now discuss the phenomenon of diffraction.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override"><br class="calibre6" /></span></p>

    <p class="subheading">10.6.1 The single slit</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">In the discussion of Young’s experiment, we stated that a single narrow slit acts as a new source from which light spreads out. Even before Young, early experimenters &ndash; including Newton &ndash; had noticed that light spreads out from narrow holes and slits. It seems to turn around corners and enter regions where we would expect a shadow. These effects, known as</span> <span class="char-style-override">diffraction</span><span class="char-style-override">, can only be properly understood using wave ideas. After all, you are hardly surprised to hear sound waves from someone talking around a corne</span><span class="char-style-override">r</span><span class="char-style-override">!</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">When the double slit in Young’s experiment is replaced by a single narrow slit (illuminated by a monochromatic source), a broad pattern with a central bright region is seen. On both sides, there are alternate dark and bright regions, the intensity becoming weaker away from the centre (Fig. 10.16). To understand this, go to Fig. 10.15, which shows a parallel beam of light falling normally on a single slit LN of width</span> <span class="char-style-override">a</span><span class="char-style-override">. The diffracted light goes on to meet a screen. The midpoint of the slit is M.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">A straight line through M perpendicular to the slit plane meets the screen at C. We want the intensity at any point P on the screen. As before, straight lines joining P to the different points L,M,N, etc., can be treated as parallel, making an angle</span> <span class="char-style-override">θ</span> <span class="char-style-override">with the normal MC.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The basic idea is to divide the slit into much smaller parts, and add their contributions at P with the proper phase differences. We are treating different parts of the wavefront at the slit as secondary sources. Because the incoming wavefront is parallel to the plane of the slit, these sources are in phase.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The path difference NP &ndash; LP between the two edges of the slit can be calculated exactly as for Young’s experiment. From Fig. 10.15,</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">NP &ndash; LP = NQ</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">=</span> <span class="char-style-override">a</span> <span class="char-style-override">sin</span> <span class="char-style-override">θ</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Similarly, if two points M</span><span class="char-style-override"><sub class="calibre11">1</sub></span> <span class="char-style-override">and M</span><span class="char-style-override"><sub class="calibre11">2</sub></span> <span class="char-style-override">in the slit plane are separated by</span> <span class="char-style-override">y</span><span class="char-style-override">, the path difference M</span><span class="char-style-override"><sub class="calibre11">2</sub></span><span class="char-style-override">P &ndash; M</span><span class="char-style-override"><sub class="calibre11">1</sub></span><span class="char-style-override">P</span> <span class="char-style-override">≈</span> <span class="char-style-override">y</span><span class="char-style-override">θ</span><span class="char-style-override">. We now have to sum up equal, coherent contributions from a large number of sources, each with a different phase. This calculation was made by Fresnel using integral calculus, so we omit it here. The main features of the diffraction pattern can be understood by simple arguments.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">At the central point</span> <span class="char-style-override">C</span> <span class="char-style-override">on the screen, the angle</span> <span class="char-style-override">θ</span> <span class="char-style-override">is zero.

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">We now compare and contrast the interference pattern with that seen for a coherently illuminated single slit (usually called the single slit diffraction pattern).</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">(i) The interference pattern has a number of equally spaced bright and dark bands.

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">(ii) We calculate the interference pattern by superposing two waves originating from the two narrow slits. The diffraction pattern is a superposition of a continuous family of waves originating from each point on a single slit.</span></p>

The width</span> <span class="char-style-override">a</span> <span class="char-style-override">of each slit must be even smaller, of the order of 0.1 or 0.2 mm.</span></p>

Parallel paths from the slit are combined at a single point on the screen.</span> <span class="char-style-override">Note that the lens does not introduce any extra path differences in a parallel beam</span><span class="char-style-override">.

    <p class="subheading">10.6.2 Seeing the single slit diffraction pattern</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">It is surprisingly easy to see the single-slit diffraction pattern for oneself. The equipment needed can be found in most homes &ndash;&ndash; two razor blades and one clear glass electric bulb preferably with a straight filament. One has to hold the two blades so that the edges are parallel and have a narrow slit in between. This is easily done with the thumb and forefingers (Fig. 10.18).</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Keep the slit parallel to the filament, right in front of the eye. Use spectacles if you normally do. With slight adjustment of the width of the slit and the parallelism of the edges, the pattern should be seen with its bright and dark bands. Since the position of all the bands (except the central one) depends on wavelength, they will show some colours. Using a filter for red or blue will make the fringes clearer. With both filters available, the wider fringes for red compared to blue can be seen.</span></p>

The bulb filament can be viewed as before to repeat Young’s experiment. In daytime, there is another suitable bright source subtending a small angle at the eye. This is the reflection of the Sun in any shiny convex surface (e.g., a cycle bell).

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">In interference and diffraction, light energy is redistributed. If it reduces in one region, producing a dark fringe, it increases in another region, producing a bright fringe. There is no gain or loss of energy, which is consistent with the principle of conservation of energy.</span></p>

    <p class="subheading">10.6.3 Resolving power of optical instruments</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">In Chapter 9 we had discussed about telescopes. The angular resolution of the telescope is determined by the objective of the telescope. The stars which are not resolved in the image produced by the objective cannot be resolved by any further magnification produced by the eyepiece. The primary purpose of the eyepiece is to provide magnification of the image produced by the objective.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Consider a parallel beam of light falling on a convex lens. If the lens is well corrected for aberrations, then geometrical optics tells us that the beam will get focused to a point. However, because of diffraction, the beam instead of getting focused to a point gets focused to a spot of finite area. In this case the effects due to diffraction can be taken into account by considering a plane wave incident on a circular aperture followed by a convex lens (Fig. 10.19). The analysis of the corresponding diffraction pattern is quite involved; however, in principle, it is similar to the analysis carried out to obtain the single-slit diffraction pattern. Taking into account the effects due to diffraction, the pattern on the focal plane would consist of a central bright region surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings (Fig. 10.19).

All the black stripes should be of equal width, while the width of the intermediate white stripes should increase as you go from the left to the right. For example, let all black stripes have a width of 5 mm. Let the width of the first two white stripes be 0.5 mm each, the next two white stripes be 1 mm each, the next two 1.5 mm each, etc. Paste this pattern on a wall in a room or laboratory, at the height of your eye.</p>

All the black stripes to the left of this stripe would merge into one another and would not be distinguishable. On the other hand, the black stripes to the right of this would be more and more clearly visible. Note the width <span class="char-style-override">d</span> of the white stripe which separates the two regions, and measure the distance <span class="char-style-override">D</span> of the wall from your eye. Then <span class="char-style-override">d</span>/<span class="char-style-override">D</span> is the resolution of your eye.</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The resolving power of the microscope is given by the reciprocal of the minimum separation of two points seen as distinct. It can be seen from Eq. (10.30) that the resolving power can be increased by choosing a medium of higher refractive index. Usually an oil having a refractive index close to that of the objective glass is used. Such an arrangement is called an</span> <span class="char-style-override">‘oil immersion objective’</span><span class="char-style-override">. Notice that it is not possible to make sin</span><span class="char-style-override">β</span> <span class="char-style-override">larger than unity. Thus, we see that the resolving power of a microscope is basically determined by the wavelength of the light used.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">There is a likelihood of confusion between resolution and magnification, and similarly between the role of a telescope and a microscope to deal with these parameters. A telescope produces images of far objects nearer to our eye. Therefore objects which are not resolved at far distance, can be resolved by looking at them through a telescope. A microscope, on the other hand, magnifies objects (which are near to us) and produces their larger image. We may be looking at two stars or two satellites of a far-away planet, or we may be looking at different regions of a living cell. In this context, it is good to remember that a telescope resolves whereas a microscope magnifies.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">It should be mentioned that the linearly polarised waves [described by Eqs.

Finally, if the plane of vibration of the string is changed randomly in very short intervals of time, then we have what is known as an</span> <span class="char-style-override">unpolarised wave</span><span class="char-style-override">. Thus, for an unpolarised wave the displacement will be randomly changing with time though it will always be perpendicular to the direction of propagation.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Light waves are transverse in nature; i.e., the electric field associated with a propagating light wave is always at right angles to the direction of propagation of the wave.

A polaroid consists of long chain molecules aligned in a particular direction. The electric vectors (associated with the propagating light wave) along the direction of the aligned molecules get absorbed.

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Thus, if the light from an ordinary source (like a sodium lamp) passes through a polaroid sheet</span> <span class="char-style-override">P</span><span class="char-style-override"><sub class="calibre11">1</sub>,</span> <span class="char-style-override">it is observed that its intensity is reduced by half.

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The light from a clear blue portion of the sky shows a rise and fall of intensity when viewed through a polaroid which is rotated. This is nothing but sunlight, which has changed its direction (having been scattered) on encountering the molecules of the earth’s atmosphere. As Fig. 10.23(a) shows, the incident sunlight is unpolarised. The dots stand for polarisation perpendicular to the plane of the figure. The double arrows show polarisation in the plane of the figure. (There is no phase relation between these two in unpolarised light). Under the influence of the electric field of the incident wave the electrons in the molecules acquire components of motion in both these directions. We have drawn an observer looking at 90° to the direction of the sun. Clearly, charges accelerating parallel to the double arrows do not radiate energy towards this observer since their acceleration has no transverse component. The radiation scattered by the molecule is therefore represented by dots. It is polarised perpendicular to the plane of the figure. This explains the polarisation of scattered light from the sky.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">The scattering of light by molecules was intensively investigated by C.V. Raman and his collaborators in Kolkata in the 1920s. Raman was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1930 for this work.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Figure 10.23(b) shows light reflected from a transparent medium, say, water. As before, the dots and arrows indicate that both polarisations are present in the incident and refracted waves. We have drawn a situation in which the reflected wave travels at right angles to the refracted wave. The oscillating electrons in the water produce the reflected wave. These move in the two directions transverse to the radiation from wave in the medium, i.e., the</span> <span class="char-style-override">refracted</span> <span class="char-style-override">wave</span><span class="char-style-override">. The arrows are parallel to the direction of the</span> <span class="char-style-override">reflected</span> <span class="char-style-override">wave. Motion in this direction does not contribute to the reflected wave. As the figure shows, the reflected light is therefore linearly polarised perpendicular to the plane of the figure (represented by dots). This can be checked by looking at the reflected light through an analyser. The transmitted intensity will be zero when the axis of the analyser is in the plane of the figure, i.e., the plane of incidence.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">When unpolarised light is incident on the boundary between two transparent media, the reflected light is polarised with its electric vector perpendicular to the plane of incidence when the refracted and reflected rays make a right angle with each other.

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">For simplicity, we have discussed scattering of light by 90º, and reflection at the Brewster angle. In this special situation, one of the two perpendicular components of the electric field is zero. At other angles, both components are present but one is stronger than the other. There is no stable phase relationship between the two perpendicular components since these are derived from two perpendicular components of an unpolarised beam.

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">Let us try to understand the situation. When an unpolarised beam of light is incident at the Brewster’s angle on an interface of two media, only part of light with electric field vector perpendicular to the plane of incidence will be reflected.

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">We began this chapter by pointing out that there are some phenomena which can be explained only by the wave theory. In order to develop a proper understanding, we first described how some phenomena like reflection and refraction, which were studied on this basis of Ray Optics in Chapter 9, can also be understood on the basis of Wave Optics. Then we described Young’s double slit experiment which was a turning point in the study of optics. Finally, we described some associated points such as diffraction, resolution, polarisation, and validity of ray optics. In the next chapter, you will see how new experiments led to new theories at the turn of the century around 1900 A.D.</span></p>

      <p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="normal">1. Huygens’ principle tells us that each point on a wavefront is a source of secondary waves, which add up to give the wavefront at a later time.</p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">2. Huygens’ construction tells us that the new wavefront is the forward envelope of the secondary waves. When the speed of light is independent of direction, the secondary waves are spherical. The rays are then perpendicular to both the wavefronts and the time of travel is the same measured along any ray. This principle leads to the well known laws of reflection and refraction.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">3. The principle of superposition of waves applies whenever two or more sources of light illuminate the same point. When we consider the intensity of light due to these sources at the given point, there is an interference term in addition to the sum of the individual intensities. But this term is important only if it has a non-zero average, which occurs only if the sources have the same frequency and a stable phase difference.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">4. Young’s double slit of separation</span> <span class="char-style-override">d</span> <span class="char-style-override">gives equally spaced fringes of angular separation</span> <span class="char-style-override">λ</span><span class="char-style-override">/d</span><span class="char-style-override">. The source, mid-point of the slits, and central bright fringe lie in a straight line. An extended source will destroy the fringes if it subtends angle more than</span> <span class="char-style-override">λ</span><span class="char-style-override">/d</span> <span class="char-style-override">at the slits.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">5. A single slit of width</span> <span class="char-style-override">a</span> <span class="char-style-override">gives a diffraction pattern with a central maximum. The intensity falls to zero at angles of</span> <span class="char-style-override"><span class="char-style-override"><img alt="2817.png" class="calibre5" src="images/000018.png" /></span></span> <span class="char-style-override">etc., with successively weaker secondary maxima in between. Diffraction limits the angular resolution of a telescope to</span> <span class="char-style-override">λ</span><span class="char-style-override">/D</span> <span class="char-style-override">where</span> <span class="char-style-override">D</span> <span class="char-style-override">is the diameter. Two stars closer than this give strongly overlapping images. Similarly, a microscope objective subtending angle 2</span><span class="char-style-override">β</span> <span class="char-style-override">at the focus, in a medium of refractive index</span> <span class="char-style-override">n</span><span class="char-style-override">, will just separate two objects spaced at a distance</span> <span class="char-style-override">λ</span><span class="char-style-override">/(2</span><span class="char-style-override">n</span> <span class="char-style-override">sin</span> <span class="char-style-override">β)</span><span class="char-style-override">, which is the resolution limit of a microscope. Diffraction determines the limitations of the concept of light rays. A beam of width</span> <span class="char-style-override">a</span> <span class="char-style-override">travels a distance</span> <span class="char-style-override">a</span><span class="char-style-override">2</span><span class="char-style-override">/</span><span class="char-style-override">λ</span><span class="char-style-override">, called the Fresnel distance, before it starts to spread out due to diffraction.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">6. Natural light, e.g., from the sun is unpolarised. This means the electric vector takes all possible directions in the transverse plane, rapidly and randomly, during a measurement. A polaroid transmits only one component (parallel to a special axis). The resulting light is called linearly polarised or plane polarised. When this kind of light is viewed through a second polaroid whose axis turns through 2</span><span class="char-style-override">π</span><span class="char-style-override">, two maxima and minima of intensity are seen. Polarised light can also be produced by reflection at a special angle (called the Brewster angle) and by scattering through</span> <span class="char-style-override">π</span><span class="char-style-override">/2 in the earth’s atmosphere.</span></p>

      <p class="calibre4"><span class="char-style-override"><b class="char-style-override3">Points to Ponder</b></span></p>

      <p class="normal">1. Waves from a point source spread out in all directions, while light was seen to travel along narrow rays. It required the insight and experiment of Huygens, Young and Fresnel to understand how a wave theory could explain all aspects of the behaviour of light.</p>

      <p class="normal">2. The crucial new feature of waves is interference of amplitudes from different sources which can be both constructive and destructive, as shown in Young’s experiment.</p>

      <p class="normal">3. Even a wave falling on single slit should be regarded as a large number of sources which interefere constructively in the forward direction (<span class="char-style-override1">θ</span> = 0), and destructively in other directions.</p>

      <p class="normal">4. Diffraction phenomena define the limits of ray optics. The limit of the ability of microscopes and telescopes to distinguish very close objects is set by the wavelength of light.</p>

      <p class="normal">5. Most interference and diffraction effects exist even for longitudinal waves like sound in air. But polarisation phenomena are special to transverse waves like light waves.</p>

Use the same principle to deduce directly that a point object placed in front of a plane mirror produces a virtual image whose distance from the mirror is equal to the object distance from the mirror.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">10.14</span> <span class="char-style-override">Let us list some of the factors, which could possibly influence the speed of wave propagation:</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">(i) nature of the source.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">(ii) direction of propagation.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">(iii) motion of the source and/or observer.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override">(e) Ray optics is based on the assumption that light travels in a straight line. Diffraction effects (observed when light propagates through small apertures/slits or around small obstacles) disprove this assumption.
