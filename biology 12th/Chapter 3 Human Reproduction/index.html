    <p class="calibre4">As you are aware, humans are sexually reproducing and viviparous. The reproductive events in humans include formation of gametes (gametogenesis), i.e., sperms in males and ovum in females, transfer of sperms into the female genital tract (insemination) and fusion of male and female gametes (fertilisation) leading to formation of zygote. This is followed by formation and development of blastocyst and its attachment to the uterine wall (implantation), embryonic development (gestation) and delivery of the baby (parturition). You have learnt that these reproductive events occur after puberty. There are remarkable differences between the reproductive events in the male and in the female, for example, sperm formation continues even in old men, but formation of ovum ceases in women around the age of fifty years. Let us examine the male and female reproductive systems in human.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">Sperms released from the seminiferous tubules, are transported by the accessory ducts. Secretions of epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle and prostate are essential for maturation and motility of sperms. The seminal plasma along with the sperms constitute the</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">semen</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. The functions of male sex accessory ducts and glands are maintained by the testicular hormones (androgens).</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The process of formation of a mature female gamete is called</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">oogenesis</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">which is markedly different from spermatogenesis. Oogenesis is initiated during the embryonic development stage when a couple of million gamete mother cells (</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">oogonia</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">) are formed within each fetal ovary; no more oogonia are formed and added after birth. These cells start division and enter into prophase-I of the meiotic division and get temporarily arrested at that stage, called</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">primary oocytes</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. Each primary oocyte then gets surrounded by a layer of granulosa cells and is called the</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">primary follicle</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(Figure 3.7). A large number of these follicles degenerate during the phase from birth to puberty. Therefore, at puberty only 60,000-80,000 primary follicles are left in each ovary. The primary follicles get surrounded by more layers of granulosa cells and a new theca and are called</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">secondary follicles</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The secondary follicle soon transforms into a tertiary follicle</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">which is characterised by a fluid filled cavity called</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">antrum</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. The theca layer is organised into an inner theca interna and an outer theca externa. It is important to</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">draw your attention that it is at this stage that the primary oocyte within the tertiary follicle grows in size and completes its first meiotic division. It is an unequal division resulting in the formation of a large haploid</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">secondary oocyte</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">and a tiny first polar body (Figure 3.8b). The secondary oocyte retains bulk of the nutrient rich cytoplasm of the primary oocyte.</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Can you think of any advantage for this?</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">Does the first polar body born out of first meiotic division divide further or degenerate? At present we are not very certain about this. The tertiary follicle further changes into the mature follicle or</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">Graafian follicle</span> <span class="calibre7">(Figure 3.7).</span></p>

One ovum is released (ovulation) during the middle of each menstrual cycle. The major events of the menstrual cycle are shown in Figure 3.</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">9</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. The cycle starts with the menstrual phase, when menstrual flow occurs and it lasts for 3-5 days.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The menstrual flow results due to breakdown of endometrial lining of the uterus and its blood vessels which forms liquid that comes out through vagina.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">Menstruation only occurs if the released</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">ovum is not fertilised.

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">During copulation (coitus) semen is released by the penis into the vagina (insemination). The motile sperms swim rapidly, pass through the cervix, enter into the uterus and finally reach the ampullary region of the fallopian tube (Figure 3.11b). The ovum released by the ovary is also transported to the ampullary region where fertilisation takes place. Fertilisation can only occur if the ovum and sperms are transported simultaneously to the ampullary region. This is the reason why not all copulations lead to fertilisation and pregnancy.</p>

During fertilisation, a sperm comes in contact with the</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">zona pellucida</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">layer of the ovum (Figure 3.10) and induces changes in the membrane that block the entry of additional sperms. Thus, it ensures that only one sperm can fertilise an ovum. The secretions of the acrosome help the sperm enter into the cytoplasm of the ovum through the zona pellucida and the plasma membrane. This induces the completion of the meiotic division of the secondary oocyte. The second meiotic division is also unequal and results in the formation of a</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">second polar body</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">and a haploid ovum (ootid).

Therefore, all the haploid gametes produced by the female (ova) have the sex chromosome X whereas in the male gametes (sperms) the sex chromosome could be either X or Y, hence, 50 per cent of sperms carry the X chromosome while the other 50 per cent carry the Y. After fusion of the male and female gametes the zygote would carry either XX or XY depending on whether the sperm carrying X or Y fertilised the ovum. The zygote carrying XX would develop into a female baby and XY would form a male (you will learn more about the chromosomal patterns in Chapter 5).</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">That is why, scientifically it is correct to say that the sex of the baby is determined by the father and not by the mother!</span></p>

The embryo with 8 to 16 blastomeres is called a morula (Figure 3.11e). The morula continues to divide and transforms into blastocyst (Figure 3.11g) as it moves further into the uterus. The blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an outer layer called</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">trophoblast</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">and an inner group of cells attached to trophoblast called the</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">inner cell</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">mass.

      <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Humans are sexually reproducing and viviparous. The male reproductive system is composed of a pair of testes, the male sex accessory ducts and the accessory glands and external genitalia. Each testis has about 250 compartments called testicular lobules, and each lobule contains one to three highly coiled seminiferous tubules. Each seminiferous tubule is lined inside by spermatogonia and Sertoli cells. The spermatogonia undergo meiotic divisions leading to sperm formation, while Sertoli cells provide nutrition to the dividing germ cells. The Leydig cells outside the seminiferous tubules, synthesise and secrete testicular hormones called androgens. The male external genitalia is called penis.</p>

      <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">The female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries, a pair of oviducts, a uterus, a vagina, external genitalia, and a pair of mammary glands. The ovaries produce the female gamete (ovum) and some steroid hormones (ovarian hormones). Ovarian follicles in different stages of development are embedded in the stroma. The oviducts, uterus and vagina are female accessory ducts. The uterus has three layers namely perimetrium, myometrium and endometrium. The female external genitalia includes mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, hymen and clitoris. The mammary glands are one of the female secondary sexual characteristics.</p>

      <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Spermatogenesis results in the formation of sperms that are transported by the male sex accessory ducts. A normal human sperm is composed of a head, neck, a middle piece and tail. The process of formation of mature female gametes is called oogenesis. The reproductive cycle of female primates is called menstrual cycle. Menstrual cycle starts only after attaining sexual maturation (puberty). During ovulation only one ovum is released per menstrual cycle. The cyclical changes in the ovary and the uterus during menstrual cycle are induced by changes in the levels of pituitary and ovarian hormones. After coitus, sperms are transported to the junction of the isthmus and ampulla, where the sperm fertilises the ovum leading to formation of a diploid zygote. The presence of X or Y chromosome in the sperm determines the sex of the embryo. The zygote undergoes repeated mitotic division to form a blastocyst, which is implanted in the uterus resulting in pregnancy. After nine months of pregnancy, the fully developed foetus is ready for delivery. The process of childbirth is called parturition which is induced by a complex neuroendocrine mechanism involving cortisol, estrogens and oxytocin. Mammary glands differentiate during pregnancy and secrete milk after child-birth. The new-born baby is fed milk by the mother (lactation) during the initial few months of growth.</p>
