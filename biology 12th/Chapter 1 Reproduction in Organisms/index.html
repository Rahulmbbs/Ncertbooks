While individual organisms die without fail, species continue to live through millions of years unless threatened by natural or anthropogenic extinction. Reproduction becomes a vital process without which species cannot survive for long. Each individual leaves its progeny by asexual or sexual means. Sexual mode of reproduction enables creation of new variants, so that survival advantage is enhanced. This unit examines the general principles underlying reproductive processes in living organisms and then explains the details of this process in flowering plants and humans as easy to relate representative examples. A related perspective on human reproductive health and how reproductive ill health can be avoided is also presented to complete our understanding of biology of reproduction.</span></p>

He moved to Allahabad for higher education where he obtained his D.Sc. During his college days, he was inspired by Dr W. Dudgeon, an American missionary teacher, to develop interest in Botany and especially morphology. His teacher once expressed that if his student progresses ahead of him, it will give him a great satisfaction. These words encouraged Panchanan to enquire what he could do for his teacher in return.</span></p>

He established the Department of Botany, University of Delhi as an important centre of research in embryology and tissue culture. He also emphasised the need for initiation of work on artificial culture of immature embryos. These days, tissue culture has become a landmark in science. His work on test tube fertilisation and intra-ovarian pollination won worldwide acclaim.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">While in animals and other simple organisms the term</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-GB">asexual</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">is used unambiguously, in plants, the term</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-GB">vegetative</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">reproduction is frequently used. In plants, the units of</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-GB">vegetative propagation</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">such as</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-GB">runner, rhizome, sucker, tuber, offset, bulb</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">are all capable of giving rise to new offspring (Figure1.4).

This is nothing but the aquatic plant ‘water hyacinth’ which is one of the most invasive weeds found growing wherever there is standing water. It drains oxygen from the water, which leads to death of fishes. You will learn more about it in Chapters 13 and 14. You may find it interesting to know that this plant was introduced in India because of its beautiful flowers and shape of leaves. Since it can propagate vegetatively at a phenomenal rate and spread all over the water body in a short period of time, it is very difficult to get rid off them.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Are you aware how plants like potato, sugarcane, banana,</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">ginger, dahlia are cultivated? Have you seen small plants emerging from the buds (called eyes) of the potato tuber, from the rhizomes of banana and ginger? When you carefully try to determine the site of origin of the new plantlets in the plants listed above, you will notice that they invariably arise from the</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-GB">nodes</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">present in the modified stems of these plants.

This ability is fully exploited by gardeners and farmers for commercial propagation of such plants.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">It is interesting to note that asexual reproduction is the common method of reproduction in organisms that have a relatively simple organisation, like algae and fungi and that they shift to sexual method of reproduction just before the onset of adverse conditions.</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">Find out how sexual reproduction enables these organisms to survive during unfavourable conditions?</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">Why is sexual reproduction favoured under such conditions?</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Asexual (vegetative) as well as sexual modes of reproduction are exhibited by the higher plants.

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Sexual reproduction involves formation of the male and female gametes, either by the same individual or by different individuals of the opposite sex. These gametes fuse to form the zygote which develops to form the new organism. It is an elaborate, complex and slow process as compared to asexual reproduction. Because of the fusion of male and female gametes, sexual reproduction results in offspring that are not identical</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">to the parents or amongst themselves.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">All organisms have to reach a certain stage of growth and maturity in their life, before they can reproduce sexually.

As many of you would know, this plant flowered during September-October 2006. Its mass flowering transformed large tracks of hilly areas in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu into blue stretches and attracted a large number of tourists. In animals, the juvenile phase is followed by morphological and physiological changes prior to active reproductive behaviour.

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><i class="calibre6">Can you list the changes seen in human beings that are indicative of reproductive maturity?</i></span></p>

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Among animals, for example birds, do they lay eggs all through the year? Or is it a seasonal phenomenon? What about other animals like frogs and lizards? You will notice that, birds living in nature lay eggs only seasonally. However, birds in captivity (as in poultry farms) can be made to lay eggs throughout the year. In this case, laying eggs is not related to reproduction but is a commercial exploitation for human welfare. The females of placental mammals exhibit cyclical changes in the activities of ovaries and accessory ducts as well as hormones during the reproductive phase. In non-primate mammals like cows, sheep, rats, deers, dogs, tiger, etc., such cyclical changes during reproduction are called</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-GB">oestrus</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-GB">cycle</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">where as in primates (monkeys, apes, and humans) it is called</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-GB">menstrual cycle</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">. Many mammals, especially those living in natural, wild conditions exhibit such cycles only during favourable seasons in their reproductive phase and are therefore called seasonal breeders. Ma</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">ny other mammals are reproductively active throughout their reproductive phase and hence are called continuous breeders.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">That we all grow old (if we live long enough), is something that we recognise.</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">But what is meant by growing old?</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">The end of reproductive phase can be considered as one of the parameters of senescence or old age.

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US">In both plants and animals, hormones are responsible for the transitions between the three phases. Interaction between hormones and certain environmental factors regulate the reproductive processes and the associated behavioural expressions of organisms.</p>

The term</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-GB">fertilisation</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">is also often used for this process. The terms syngamy and fertilisation are frequently used though , interchangeably.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">What would happen if syngamy does not occur?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">However, it has to be mentioned here that in some organisms like rotifers, honeybees and even some lizards and birds (turkey), the female gamete undergoes development to form new organisms without fertilisation. This phenomenon is called</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-GB">parthenogenesis.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre10" lang="en-GB">Where does syngamy occur?</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">In most aquatic organisms, such as a majority of algae and fishes as well as amphibians, syngamy occurs in the external medium (water), i.e., outside the body of the organism. This type of gametic fusion is called</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-GB">external</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-GB">fertilisation</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">. Organisms exhibiting external fertilisation show great synchrony between the sexes and release a large number of gametes into the surrounding medium (water) in order to enhance the chances of syngamy. This happens in the bony fishes and frogs where a large number of offspring are produced. A major disadvantage is that the offspring are extremely vulnerable to predators threatening their survival up to adulthood.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">In many terrestrial organisms, belonging to fungi, higher animals such as reptiles, birds, mammals and in a majority of plants (bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms), syngamy occurs inside the body of the organism, hence the process is called</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-GB">internal fertilisation.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">In all these organisms, egg is formed inside the female body where they fuse with the male gamete. In organisms exhibiting internal fertilisation, the male gamete is motile and has to reach the egg in order to fuse with it. In these even though the number of sperms produced is very large, there is a significant reduction in the number of eggs produced. In seed plants, however, the non-motile male gametes are carried to female gamete by pollen tubes.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US">Formation of the diploid zygote is universal in all sexually reproducing organisms. In organisms with external fertilisation, zygote is formed in the external medium (usually water), whereas in those exhibiting internal fertilisation, zygote is formed inside the body of the organism.</p>

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Further development of the zygote depends on the type of life cycle the organism has and the environment it is exposed to. In organisms belonging to fungi and algae, zygote develops a thick wall that is resistant to dessication and damage. It undergoes a period of rest before germination. In organisms with haplontic life cycle (As you have read<br class="calibre4" />

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US">Reproduction enables a species to live generation after generation. Reproduction in organisms can be broadly classified into asexual and sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction does not involve the fusion of gametes. It is common in organisms that have a relatively simple organisation such as the fungi, algae and some invertebrate animals. The offspring formed by asexual reproduction are identical and are referred to as clones. Zoospores, conidia, etc., are the most common asexual structures formed in several algae and fungi. Budding and gemmule formation are the common asexual methods seen in animals.</p>

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">Prokaryotes and unicellular organisms reproduce asexually by cell division or binary fission of the parent cell. In several aquatic and terrestrial species of angiosperms, structures such as runners, rhizomes, suckers, tubers, offsets</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">, etc., are capable of giving rise to new offspring. This method of asexual reproduction is generally referred to as vegetative propagation.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US">Sexual reproduction involves the formation and fusion of gametes. It is a complex and slower process as compared to asexual reproduction. Most of the higher animals reproduce almost entirely by sexual method. Events of sexual reproduction may be categorised into pre-fertilisation, fertilisation and post-fertilisation events. Pre-fertilisation events include gametogenesis and gamete transfer while post-fertilisation events include the formation of zygote and embryogenesis.</p>

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US">Organisms may be bisexual or unisexual. Sexuality in plants is varied, particularly in angiosperms, due to the production of diverse types of flowers. Plants are defined as monoecious and dioecious. Flowers may be bisexual or unisexual flowers.</p>

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">Gametes are haploid in nature and usually a direct product of meiotic division except in haploid organisms where gametes are formed by mitosis.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">Transfer of male gametes is an essential event in sexual reproduction. It is relatively easy in bisexual organisms. In unisexual animals it occurs by copulation</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">or simultaneous release. In angiosperms, a special process called pollination ensures transfer of pollen grains which carry the pollen grains to the stigma.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US">Syngamy (fertilisation) occurs between the male and female gametes. Syngamy may occur either externally, outside the body of organisms or internally, inside the body. Syngamy leads to formation of a specialised cell called zygote.</p>

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US">The process of development of embryo from the zygote is called embryogenesis. In animals, the zygote starts developing soon after its formation. Animals may be either oviparous or viviparous. Embryonal protection and care are better in viviparous organisms.</p>

    <p class="calibre5" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">In flowering plants, after fertilisation, ovary develops into fruit and ovules mature into seeds. Inside the mature seed is the progenitor of the next generation, the embryo.</span></p>
