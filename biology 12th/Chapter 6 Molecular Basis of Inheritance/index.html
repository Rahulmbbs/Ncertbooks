    <p class="calibre4">In the previous chapter, you have learnt the inheritance patterns and the genetic basis of such patterns. At the time of Mendel, the nature of those ‘factors’ regulating the pattern of inheritance was not clear. Over the next hundred years, the nature of the putative genetic material was investigated culminating in the realisation that DNA &ndash; deoxyribonucleic acid &ndash; is the genetic material, at least for the majority of organisms. In class XI you have learnt that nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are the two types of nucleic acids found in living systems. DNA acts as the genetic material in most of the organisms. RNA though it also acts as a genetic material in some viruses, mostly functions as a messenger. RNA has additional roles as well. It functions as adapter, structural, and in some cases as a catalytic molecule. In Class XI you have already learnt the structures of nucleotides and the way these monomer units are linked to form nucleic acid polymers. In this chapter we are going to discuss the structure of DNA, its replication, the process of making RNA from DNA (transcription), the genetic code that determines the sequences of amino acids in proteins, the process of protein synthesis (translation) and elementary basis of their regulation. The determination of complete nucleotide sequence of human genome during last decade has set in a new era of genomics. In the last section, the essentials of human genome sequencing and its consequences will also be discussed.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Let us begin our discussion by first understanding the structure of the most interesting molecule in the living system, that is, the DNA. In subsequent sections, we will understand that why it is the most abundant genetic material, and what its relationship is with RNA.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">DNA is a long polymer of deoxyribonucleotides.

    <p class="chapter-text--subheading-70blac"></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">Let us recapitulate the chemical structure of a polynucleotide chain (DNA or RNA). A nucleotide has three components &ndash; a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar (ribose in case of RNA, and deoxyribose for DNA), and a phosphate group. There are two types of nitrogenous bases &ndash; Purines (Adenine and Guanine), and Pyrimidines (Cytosine, Uracil and Thymine). Cytosine is common for both DNA and RNA and Thymine is present in DNA. Uracil is present in RNA at the place of Thymine. A nitrogenous base is linked to the pentose sugar through a N-glycosidic linkage to form a nucleoside, such as adenosine or deoxyadenosine, guanosine or</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">deoxyguanosine, cytidine or deoxycytidine and uridine or deoxythymidine. When a phosphate group is linked to 5</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">'</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">-OH of a</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">nucleoside through phosphoester linkage, a corresponding nucleotide (or deoxynucleotide depending upon the type of sugar present) is formed. Two nucleotides are linked through 3</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">'</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">-5</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">'</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">phosphodiester linkage to form a dinucleotide. More nucleotides can be joined in such a manner to form a polynucleotide chain. A polymer thus formed has at one end a free phosphate moiety at 5</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">'</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">-end of ribose sugar, which is referred to as 5’-end of polynucleotide chain.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">Similarly, at the other end of the polymer the ribose has a free<br class="calibre3" />
    3</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">'</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">-OH group which is referred to as</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">3</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">'</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">-</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">end of the polynucleotide chain. The backbone in a polynucleotide chain is formed due to sugar and phosphates. The nitrogenous bases linked to sugar moiety project from the backbone (Figure 6.1).</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">In RNA, every nucleotide residue has an additional &ndash;OH group present at 2</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">'</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">-position in the ribose. Also, in RNA the uracil is found at the place of thymine (5-methyl uracil, another chemical name for thymine).</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">DNA as an acidic substance present in nucleus was first identified by Friedrich Meischer in 1869.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">He named it as ‘Nuclein’. However, due to technical limitation in isolating such a long polymer intact, the elucidation of structure of DNA remained elusive for a very long period of time. It was only in 1953 that James Watson and Francis Crick, based on the X-ray diffraction data produced by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin, proposed a very simple but famous</span> <b class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">Double Helix</span></b> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">model for the structure of DNA. One of the hallmarks of their proposition was base pairing between the two strands of polynucleotide chains. However, this proposition was also based on the observation of Erwin Chargaff that for a double stranded DNA, the ratios between</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB"><b class="calibre6">Adenine</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">and</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB"><b class="calibre6">Thymine</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">and</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB"><b class="calibre6">Guanine</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">and</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB"><b class="calibre6">Cytosine</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">are constant and equals one.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The base</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">pairing confers a very unique property to the polynucleotide chains. They are said to be complementary to each other, and therefore if the sequence of bases in one strand is known then the sequence in other strand can be predicted. Also, if each strand from a DNA (let us call it as a parental DNA) acts as a template for synthesis of a new strand, the two double stranded DNA (let us call them as daughter DNA) thus, produced would be identical to the parental DNA molecule. Because of this, the genetic implications of the structure of DNA became very clear.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">The salient features of the Double-helix structure of DNA are as follows:</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">(i) It is made of two polynucleotide chains, where the backbone is constituted by sugar-phosphate, and the bases project inside.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(ii)</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The two chains have anti-parallel polarity.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">It means, if one chain has the polarity</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">5</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">'</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"></span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">3</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">'</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">, the other has 3</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">'</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"></span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">5</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">'</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">(iii) The bases in two strands are paired through hydrogen bond (H-bonds) forming base pairs (bp). Adenine forms two hydrogen bonds with Thymine from opposite strand and vice-versa. Similarly, Guanine is bonded with Cytosine with three H-bonds. As a result, always a purine comes opposite to a pyrimidine. This generates approximately uniform distance between the two strands of the helix (Figure 6.2).</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(iv)</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The two chains are coiled in a right</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">-handed fashion. The pitch of the helix is 3.4 nm (a nanometre is one billionth of a metre, that is 10</span><sup class="calibre8">-9</sup> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">m) and there a</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">re roughly 10 bp in each turn. Consequently, the distance between a bp in</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">a</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">helix is</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">approximately equal to 0.34 nm.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">In eukaryotes, this organisation is much more complex. There is a set of positively charged, basic proteins called</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">histones</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. A protein acquires charge depending upon the abundance of amino acids residues with charged side chains. Histones are rich in the basic amino acid residues lysines and arginines. Both the amino acid residues carry positive charges in their side chains. Histones are organised to form a unit of eight molecules called as</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">histone octamer</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. The negatively charged DNA is wrapped around the positively charged histone octamer to form a structure called</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">nucleosome</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(Figure 6.4 a).

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Even though the discovery of nuclein by Meischer and the proposition for principles of inheritance by Mendel were almost at the same time, but that the DNA acts as a genetic material took long to be discovered and proven. By 1926, the quest to determine the mechanism for genetic inheritance had reached the molecular level. Previous discoveries by Gregor Mendel, Walter Sutton, Thomas Hunt Morgan and numerous other scientists had narrowed the search to the chromosomes located in the nucleus of most cells. But the question of what molecule was actually the genetic material, had not been answered.</p>

    <p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre7">When</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> <span class="calibre7">(pneumococcus) bacteria are grown on a culture plate, some produce smooth shiny colonies (S) while others produce rough colonies (R). This is because the S strain bacteria have a mucous (polysaccharide) coat, while R strain does not.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Prior to the work of Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty (1933-44), the genetic material was thought to be a protein. They worked to determine the biochemical nature of ‘transforming principle’ in Griffith's experiment.</p>

    <p class="chapter-text--subheading-70blac" lang="en-US">6.2.1 The Genetic Material is DNA</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">The unequivocal proof that DNA is the genetic material came from the experiments of Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase (1952). They worked with viruses that infect bacteria called bacteriophages.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">The bacteriophage attaches to the bacteria and its genetic material then enters the bacterial cell. The bacterial cell treats the viral genetic material as if it was its own and subsequently manufactures more virus particles. Hershey and Chase worked to discover whether it was protein or DNA from the viruses that entered the bacteria.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">They grew some viruses on a medium that contained radioactive phosphorus and some others on medium that contained radioactive sulfur. Viruses grown in the presence of radioactive phosphorus contained radioactive DNA but not radioactive protein because DNA contains phosphorus but protein does not. Similarly, viruses grown on radioactive sulfur contained radioactive protein but not radioactive DNA because DNA does not contain sulfur.</p>

    <p class="calibre4"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">Radioactive phages were allowed to attach to</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">E. coli</span> <span class="calibre7">bacteria. Then, as the infection proceeded, the viral coats were removed from the bacteria by agitating them in a blender. The virus particles were separated from the bacteria by spinning them in a centrifuge.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Bacteria which was infected with viruses that had radioactive DNA were radioactive, indicating that DNA was the material that passed from the virus to the bacteria. Bacteria that were infected with viruses that had radioactive proteins were not radioactive. This indicates that proteins did not enter the bacteria from the viruses. DNA is therefore the genetic material that is passed from virus to bacteria (Figure 6.5).</p>

    <p class="chapter-text--subheading-70blac" lang="en-US">6.2.2 Properties of Genetic Material (DNA versus RNA)</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">From the foregoing discussion, it is clear that the debate between proteins versus DNA as the genetic material was unequivocally resolved from Hershey</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">-Chase experiment. It became an established fact that it is DNA that acts as genetic material. However, it subsequently became clear that in some viruses, RNA is the genetic material (for example, Tobacco Mosaic viruses, QB bacteriophage, etc.). Answer to some of the questions such as, why DNA is the predominant genetic material, whereas RNA performs dynamic functions of messenger and adapter has to be found from the differences between chemical structures of the two nucleic acid molecules.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">Can you recall the two chemical differences between DNA and RNA?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">A molecule that can act as a genetic material must fulfill the following criteria:</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">(i) It should be able to generate its replica (Replication).</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">(ii) It should chemically and structurally be stable.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">(iii) It should provide the scope for slow changes (mutation) that are required for evolution.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">(iv) It should be able to express itself in the form of 'Mendelian Characters’.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">If one examines each requirement one by one, because of rule of base pairing and complementarity, both the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) have the ability to direct their duplications. The other molecules in the living system, such as proteins fail to fulfill first criteria itself.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The genetic material should be stable enough not to change with different stages of life cycle, age or with change in physiology of the organism. Stability as one of the properties of genetic material was very evident in Griffith’s ‘transforming principle’ itself that heat, which killed the bacteria, at least did not destroy some of the properties of genetic material. This now can easily be explained in light of the DNA that the two strands being complementary if separated by heating come together, when appropriate conditions are provided. Further,</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">2</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">'</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">-OH group present at every nucleotide in RNA is a reactive group and makes RNA labile and easily degradable. RNA is also now known to be catalytic, hence reactive. Therefore, DNA chemically is less reactive and structurally more stable when compa</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">red to RNA.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">Therefore, among the two nucleic acids, the DNA is a better genetic material.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">In fact, the presence of thymine at the place of uracil also confers additional stability to DNA. (Detailed discussion about this requires understanding of the process of repair in DNA, and you will study these processes in higher classes.)</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Both DNA and RNA are able to mutate. In fact, RNA being unstable, mutate at a faster rate. Consequently, viruses having RNA genome and having shorter life span mutate and evolve faster.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">RNA can directly code for the synthesis of proteins, hence can easily express the characters. DNA, however, is dependent on RNA for synthesis of proteins. The protein synthesising machinery has evolved around RNA. The above discussion indicate that both RNA and DNA can function as genetic material, but DNA being more stable is preferred for storage of genetic information. For the transmission of genetic information, RNA<br class="calibre3" />
    is better.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">RNA was the first genetic material.

But, RNA being a catalyst was reactive and hence unstable. Therefore, DNA has evolved from RNA with chemical modifications that make it more stable. DNA being double stranded and having complementary strand further resists changes by evolving a process of repair.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">While proposing the double helical structure for DNA, Watson and Crick had immediately proposed a scheme for replication of DNA. To quote their original statement that is as follows:</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">‘‘It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material’’ (Watson and Crick, 1953).</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The scheme suggested that the two strands would separate and act as a template for the synthesis of new complementary strands.

The main enzyme is referred to as DNA-dependent</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">DNA polymerase</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">, since it uses a DNA template to catalyse the polymerisation of deoxynucleotides. These enzymes are highly efficient enzymes as they have to catalyse polymerisation of a large number of nucleotides in a very short time.</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">E. coli</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">that has only 4.</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">6</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">×</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">10</span><sup class="calibre8">6</sup> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">bp (compare it with human whose diploid content is 6.6 ×</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">10</span><sup class="calibre8">9</sup> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">bp), completes the process of replication within 18 minutes; that means the average rate of polymerisation has to be approximately 2000 bp per second. Not only do these polymerases have to be fast, but they also have to catalyse the reaction</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">with high degree of accuracy. Any mistake during replication would result into mutations. Furthermore, energetically replication is a very expensive process. Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates serve dual purposes. In addition to acting as substrates, they provide energy for polymerisation reaction (the two terminal phosphates in a deoxynucleoside triphosphates are high-energy phosphates, same as in case of ATP).</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">In addition to DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, many additional enzymes are required to complete the process of replication with high degree of accuracy. For long DNA molecules, since the two strands of DNA cannot be separated in its entire length (due to very high energy requirement), the replication occur within a small opening of the DNA helix, referred to as</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">replication fork</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">.

The discontinuously synthesised fragments are later joined by the enzyme</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">DNA ligase</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(Figure 6.8).</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The DNA polymerases on their own cannot initiate the process of replication.

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The process of copying genetic information from one strand of the DNA into RNA is termed as</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">transcription</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. Here also, the principle of complementarity governs the process of transcription, except the adenosine now forms base pair with uracil instead of thymine. However, unlike in the process of replication, which once set in, the total DNA of an organism gets duplicated, in transcription only a segment of DNA and only one of the strands is copied into RNA. This necessitates defining the boundaries that would demarcate the region and the strand of DNA that would be transcribed.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Why both the strands are not copied during transcription has the simple answer. First, if both strands act as a template, they would code for RNA molecule with different sequences (Remember complementarity does not mean identical), and in turn, if they code for proteins, the sequence of amino acids in the proteins would be different. Hence, one segment of the DNA would be coding for two different proteins, and this would complicate the genetic information transfer machinery. Second, the two RNA molecules if produced simultaneously would be complementary to each other, hence would form a double stranded RNA. This would prevent RNA from being translated into protein and the exercise of transcription would become a futile one.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">A gene is defined as the functional unit of inheritance. Though there is no ambiguity that the genes are located on the DNA, it is difficult to literally define a gene in terms of DNA sequence. The DNA sequence coding for tRNA or rRNA molecule also define a gene. However by defining a</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">cistron</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">as a segment of DNA coding for a polypeptide, the structural gene in a transcription unit could be said as</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">monocistronic</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(mostly in eukaryotes) or</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">polycistronic</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(mostly in bacteria or prokaryotes). In eukaryotes, the monocistronic structural genes have interrupted coding sequences &ndash; the genes in eukaryotes are split. The coding sequences or expressed sequences are defined as</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">exons</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. Exons are said to be those sequence that appear in mature or processed RNA. The exons are interrupted by</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">introns</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. Introns or intervening sequences do not appear in mature or processed RNA. The split-gene arrangement further complicates the definition of a gene in terms of a DNA segment.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">Inheritance of a character is also affected by promoter and regulatory sequences of a structural gene. Hence, sometime the regulatory sequences are loosely defined as regulatory genes, even though these sequences do not code for any RNA or</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">protein.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-text-subheadinglower"></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">In bacteria, there are three major types of RNAs: mRNA (messenger RNA), tRNA (transfer RNA), and rRNA (ribosomal RNA). All three RNAs are needed to synthesise a protein in a cell. The mRNA provides the template, tRNA brings aminoacids and reads the genetic code, and rRNAs play structural and catalytic role during translation. There is single DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that catalyses transcription of all types of RNA in bacteria. RNA polymerase binds to promoter and initiates transcription (</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">Initiation</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">). It uses nucleoside triphosphates as substrate and polymerises in a template depended fashion following the rule of complementarity. It somehow also facilitates opening of the helix and continues elongation. Only a short stretch of RNA remains bound to the enzyme. Once the polymerases reaches the terminator region, the nascent RNA falls off, so also the RNA polymerase. This results in</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">termination</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">of transcription.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">An intriguing question is that how</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">is the RNA polymerases able to catalyse all the three steps, which are initiation, elongation and termination. The RNA polymerase is only capable of catalysing</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">the process of elongation. It associates transiently with</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">initiation-factor</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">σ</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">)</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">and</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">termination-factor</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">ρ</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">) to initiate and terminate the transcription, respectively. Association with these factors alter the specificity of the RNA polymerase to either initiate or terminate (Figure 6.10).</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">In bacteria</span><span class="calibre7">, since the mRNA does not require any processing to become active, and also since transcription and translation take place in the same compartment (there is no separation of cytosol and nucleus in bacteria), many times the translation can begin much before the mRNA is fully transcribed. Consequently, the transcription and translation can be coupled in bacteria.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">In eukaryotes, there are two additional complexities</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">&ndash;</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(i)</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">There are at least three RNA polymerases in the nucleus (in addition to the RNA polymerase found in the organelles).</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">There is a clear cut division of labour. The RNA polymerase I transcribes</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">rRNAs</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
    (28S, 18S, and 5.8S), whereas the RNA polymerase III is responsible for transcription of</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">tRNA</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">,</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">5srRNA</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">, and</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">snRNAs</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">small nuclear RNAs</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">). The RNA polymerase II transcribes precursor of mRNA, the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">heterogeneous nuclear RNA</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">hnRNA</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">).</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(ii) The second complexity is that the primary transcripts contain both the exons and the introns and are non-functional. Hence, it is subjected to a process called</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">splicing</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">where the introns are removed and exons are joined in a defined order. hnRNA undergoes additional processing called as capping and tailing. In</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">capping</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">an unusual nucleotide (methyl guanosine triphosphate) is added to the 5</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">'</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">-</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">end of hnRNA. In</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">tailing</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">, adenylate residues (200-300) are added at 3</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">'</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">-</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">end in a template independent manner.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">It is the fully processed hnRNA, now called mRNA, that is transported out of the nucleus for translation (Figure 6.11).</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The significance of such complexities is now beginning to be understood. The split-gene arrangements represent probably an ancient feature of the genome. The presence of introns is reminiscent of antiquity, and the process of splicing represents the dominance of</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">RNA-world</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. In recent times, the understanding of RNA and RNA-dependent processes in the living system have assumed more importance.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-text-heading" lang="en-US">6.6 Genetic Code</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">During replication and transcription a nucleic acid was copied to form another nucleic acid. Hence, these processes are easy to conceptualise on the basis of complementarity. The process of translation requires transfer of genetic information from a polymer of nucleotides to a polymer of amino acids. Neither does any complementarity exist between nucleotides and amino acids, nor could any be drawn theoretically. There existed ample evidences, though, to support the notion that change in nucleic acids (genetic material) were responsible for change in amino acids in proteins. This led to the proposition of a genetic code that could direct the sequence of amino acids during synthesis of proteins.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">If determining the biochemical nature of genetic material and the structure of DNA was very exciting, the proposition and deciphering of genetic code were most challenging. In a very true sense, it required involvement of scientists from several disciplines &ndash; physicists, organic chemists, biochemists and geneticists. It was George Gamow, a physicist, who argued that since there are only 4 bases and if they have to code for 20 amino acids, the code should constitute a combination of bases. He suggested that in order to code for all the 20 amino acids, the code should be made up of three nucleotides. This was a very bold proposition, because a permutation combination of 4</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">3</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(4 × 4 × 4) would generate 64 codons; generating many more codons than required.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4">Providing proof that the codon was a triplet, was a more daunting task. The chemical method developed by Har Gobind Khorana was instrumental in synthesising RNA molecules with defined combinations of bases (homopolymers and copolymers). Marshall Nirenberg’s cell-free system for protein synthesis finally helped the code to be deciphered. Severo Ochoa enzyme (polynucleotide phosphorylase) was also helpful in polymerising RNA with defined sequences in a template independent manner (enzymatic synthesis of RNA). Finally a checker-board for genetic code was prepared which is given in Table 6.1.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The salient fea</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">tures of genetic code are as follows:</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(i)</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The codon is triplet.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">61 codons code for amino acids and 3 codons do not code for any amino acids, hence they function as stop codons.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(ii) One codon codes for only one amino acid, hence, it is</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">unambiguous</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">and</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">specific</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(iii) Some amino acids are coded by more than one codon, hence the code is</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">degenerate</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">(iv) The codon is read in mRNA in a contiguous fashion. There are no punctuations.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">Regulation</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">of gene expression refers to a very broad term that may occur at various levels. Considering that gene expression results in the formation of a polypeptide, it can be regulated at several levels. In eukaryotes, the regulation could be exerted at</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">(i) transcriptional level (formation of primary transcript),</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">(ii) processing level (regulation of splicing),</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">(iii) transport of mRNA from nucleus to the cytoplasm,</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(iv) translational level.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The genes i</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">n a cell are expressed to perform a particular function or a set of functions. For example, if an enzyme called beta-galactosidase is synthesised by</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">E.</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">coli</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">, it is used to catalyse the hydrolysis of a disaccharide, lactose into galactose and glucose; the bacteria use them as a source of energy. Hence, if the bacteria do not have lactose around them to be utilised for energy source, they would no longer require the synthesis of the enzyme beta-galactosidase. Therefore, in simple terms, it is the metabolic, physiological or environmental conditions that regulate the expression of genes. The development and differentiation of embryo into adult organisms are also a result of the coordinated regulation of expression of several sets of genes.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">In prokaryotes, control of the rate of transcriptional initiation is the predominant site for control of gene expression. In a transcription unit, the activity of RNA polymerase at a given promoter is in turn regulated by interaction with accessory proteins, which affect its ability to recognise start sites. These regulatory proteins can act both positively (activators) and negatively (repressors). The accessibility of promoter regions of prokaryotic DNA is in many cases regulated by the interaction of proteins with sequences termed</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">operators</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. The operator region is adjacent to the promoter elements in most operons and in most cases the sequences of the operator bind a repressor protein. Each operon has its specific operator and specific repressor. For example,</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">lac</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">operator is present only in the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">lac</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">operon and it interacts specifically with</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">lac</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">repressor only.</span></p>

Such arrangement is very common in bacteria and is referred to as</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">operon</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">.

In most other operons as well, the genes present in the operon are needed together to function in the same or related metabolic pathway (Figure 6.14).</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">Lactose is the substrate for the enzyme beta-galactosidase and it regulates switching on and off of the operon. Hence, it is te</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">rmed as</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">inducer</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. In the absence of a preferred carbon source such as glucose, if lactose is provided in the growth medium of the bacteria, the lactose is transported into the cells through the action of permease (Remember, a very low level of expression of</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">lac</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">operon has to be present in the cell all the time, otherwise lactose cannot enter the cells). The lactose then induces the operon in the following manner.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The repressor of the operon is synthesised (all-the-time &ndash; constitutively) from the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">i</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">gene. The repressor protein binds to the operator region of the operon and prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the operon. In the presence of an inducer, such as lactose or allolactose, the repressor is inactivated by interaction with the inducer. This allows RNA polymerase access to the promoter and transcription proceeds (Figure 6.14). Essentially, regulation of</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">lac</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">operon can also be visualised as regulation of enzyme synthesis by its substrate.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">Remember, glucose or galactose cannot act as inducers for lac operon. Can you think for how long the lac operon would be expressed in the presence of lactose?</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-text-heading" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">6.9 Human Genome Project</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7">In the preceding sections you have learnt that it is the sequence of bases in DNA that determines the genetic information of a given organism. In other words, genetic make-up of an organism or an individual lies in the DNA sequences. If two individuals differ, then their DNA sequences should also be different, at least at some places. These assumptions led to the quest of finding out the complete DNA sequence of human genome. With the establishment of genetic engineering techniques where it was possible to isolate and clone any piece of DNA and availability of simple and fast techniques for determining DNA sequences, a very ambitious project of sequencing human genome was launched in the year 1990.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7">Human Genome Project</span> <span class="calibre7">(HGP) was called a mega project. You can imagine the magnitude and the requirements for the project if we simply define the aims of the project as follows:</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7">Human genome is said to have approximately 3 x 10</span><span class="calibre7">9</span> <span class="calibre7">bp, and if the cost of sequencing required is US $ 3 per bp (the estimated cost in the beginning), the total estimated cost of the project would be approximately 9 billion US dollars. Further, if the obtained sequences were to be stored in typed form in books, and if each page of the book contained 1000 letters and each book contained 1000 pages, then 3300 such books would be required to store the information of DNA sequence from a single human cell. The enormous amount of data expected to be generated also necessitated the use of high speed computational devices for data storage and retrieval, and analysis. HGP was closely associated with the rapid development of a new area in biology called</span> <span class="calibre7">Bioinformatics.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" /></span></p>

    <p class="chapter-text--subheading-70blac" lang="en-US"><b class="calibre6">Goals of HGP</b></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7">Some of the important goals of HGP were as follows:</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7">(i) I</span><span class="calibre7">dentify all the approximately 20,000-25,000 genes in human DNA</span><span class="calibre7">;</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7">The Human Genome Project was a 13-year project coordinated by the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health. During the early years of the HGP, the Wellcome Trust (U.K.) became a major partner; additional contributions came from Japan, France, Germany, China and others. The project was completed in 2003. Knowledge about the effects of DNA variations among individuals can lead to revolutionary new ways to diagnose, treat and someday prevent the thousands of disorders that affect human beings. Besides providing clues to understanding human biology, learning about non-human organisms DNA sequences can lead to an understanding of their natural capabilities that can be applied toward solving challenges in health care, agriculture, energy production, environmental remediation. Many non-human model organisms, such as bacteria, yeast,</span> <span class="calibre7">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> <span class="calibre7">(a free living non-pathogenic nematode),</span> <span class="calibre7">Drosophila</span> <span class="calibre7">(the fruit fly), plants (rice and</span> <span class="calibre7">Arabidopsis</span><span class="calibre7">), etc., have also been sequenced.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7"><b class="calibre6">Methodologies</b> :</span> <span class="calibre7">The methods involved two major approaches. One approach focused on identifying all the genes that are expressed as RNA (referred to as</span> <span class="calibre7">Expressed Sequence Tags</span> <span class="calibre7">(ESTs). The other took the blind approach of simply sequencing the whole set of genome that contained all the coding and non-coding sequence, and later assigning different regions in the sequence with functions (a term referred to as</span> <span class="calibre7">Sequence Annotation</span><span class="calibre7">). For sequencing, the total DNA from a cell is isolated and converted into random fragments of relatively smaller sizes (recall DNA is a very long polymer, and there are technical limitations in sequencing very long pieces of DNA) and cloned in suitable host using specialised vectors. The cloning resulted into amplification of each piece of DNA fragment so that it subsequently could be sequenced with ease. The commonly used hosts were bacteria and yeast, and the vectors were called as</span> <span class="calibre7">BAC</span> <span class="calibre7">(bacterial artificial chromosomes), and</span> <span class="calibre7">YAC</span> <span class="calibre7">(yeast artificial chromosomes).</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre7">The fragments were sequenced using automated DNA sequencers that worked on the principle of a method developed by Frederick Sanger.

This required</span> <span class="calibre7">generation of overlapping</span> <span class="calibre7">fragments for sequencing. Alignment of these sequences was humanly not possible. Therefore, specialised computer based programs were developed (Figure 6.15). These sequences were subsequently annotated and were assigned to each chromosome. The sequence of chromosome 1 was completed only in May 2006 (this was the last of the 24 human chromosomes &ndash; 22 autosomes and X and Y &ndash; to be seque</span><span class="calibre7">nced). Another challenging task was assigning the genetic and physical maps on the genome. This was generated using information on polymorphism of restriction endonuclease recognition sites, and some repetitive DNA sequences known as microsatellites (one of the applications of polymorphism in repetitive DNA sequences shall be explained in next section of DNA fingerprinting).</span></p>

This enormous task will require the expertise and creativity of tens of thousands of scientists from varied disciplines in both the public and private sectors worldwide. One of the greatest impacts of having the HG sequence may well be enabling a radically new approach to biological research. In the past, researchers studied one or a few genes at a time. With whole-genome sequences and new high-throughput technologies, we can approach questions systematically and on a much broader scale.

    <p class="chapter-text-heading" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">6.10 DNA Fingerprinting</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7">As stated in the preceding section, 99.9 per cent of base sequence among humans is the same.</span> <span class="calibre7">Assuming human genome as 3 × 10</span><sup class="calibre8">9</sup> <span class="calibre7">bp</span><span class="calibre7">,</span> <span class="calibre7">in how many base sequences would there be differences?</span> <span class="calibre7">It is these differences in sequence of DNA which make every individual unique in their phenotypic appearance. If one aims to find out genetic differences between two individuals or among individuals of a population, sequencing the DNA every time would be a daunting and expensive task. Imagine trying to compare two sets of 3 × 10</span><sup class="calibre8">6</sup> <span class="calibre7">base pairs. DNA fingerprinting is a very quick way to compare the DNA sequences of any two individuals.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7">DNA fingerprinting involves identifying differences in some specific regions in DNA sequence called as</span> <span class="calibre7">repetitive DNA</span><span class="calibre7">,</span> <span class="calibre7">because in these sequences, a small stretch of DNA is repeated many times. These repetitive DNA are separated from bulk genomic DNA as different peaks during density gradient centrifugation. The bulk DNA forms a major peak and the other small peaks are referred to as</span> <span class="calibre7">satellite DNA</span><span class="calibre7">. Depending on base composition (A : T rich or G:C rich), length of segment, and number of repetitive units, the satellite DNA is classified into many categories, such as micro-satellites, mini-satellites etc. These sequences normally do not code for any proteins, but they form a large portion of human genome. These sequence show high degree of polymorphism and form the basis of DNA fingerprinting. Since DNA from every tissue (such as blood, hair-follicle, skin, bone, saliva, sperm etc.), from an individual show the same degree of polymorphism, they become very useful identification tool in forensic applications. Further, as the polymorphisms are inheritable from parents to children, DNA fingerprinting is the basis of paternity testing, in case of disputes.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7">As polymorphism in DNA sequence is the basis of genetic mapping of human genome as well as of DNA fingerprinting, it is essential that we understand what DNA polymorphism means in simple terms.</span> <span class="calibre7">Polymorphism</span> <span class="calibre7">(variation at genetic level) arises due to mutations. (Recall different kind of mutations and their effects that you have already studied in Chapter 5, and in the preceding sections in this chapter.) New mutations may arise in an individual either in somatic cells or in the germ cells (cells that generate gametes in sexually reproducing organisms). If a germ cell mutation does not seriously impair individual’s ability to have offspring who can transmit the mutation, it can spread to the other members of population (through sexual reproduction). Allelic (again recall the</span> <span class="calibre7">definition of alleles from Chapter 5) sequence variation has traditionally been described as a DNA polymorphism if more than one variant (allele) at a locus occurs in human population with a frequency greater than 0.01. In simple terms, if an</span> <span class="calibre7">inheritable mutation</span> <span class="calibre7">is observed in a population at high frequency, it is referred to as</span> <span class="calibre7">DNA polymorphism</span><span class="calibre7">. The probability of such variation to be observed in non-coding DNA sequence would be higher as mutations in these sequences may not have any immediate effect/impact in an individual’s reproductive ability. These mutations keep on accumulating generation after generation, and form one of the basis of variability/polymorphism. There is a variety of different types of polymorphisms ranging from single nucleotide change to very large scale changes. For evolution and speciation, such polymorphisms play very important role, and you will study these in details at higher classes.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7">The technique of DNA Fingerprinting was initially developed by Alec Jeffreys. He used a satellite DNA as probe that shows very high degree of polymorphism. It was called as</span> <span class="calibre7">Variable Number of Tandem</span> <span class="calibre7">Repeats</span> <span class="calibre7">(VNTR). The technique, as used earlier, involved Southern blot hybridisation using radiolabelled VNTR as a probe. It included</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre7">The VNTR belongs to a class of satellite DNA referred to as mini-satellite. A small DNA sequence is arranged tandemly in many copy numbers. The copy number varies from chromosome to chromosome in an individual. The numbers of repeat show very high degree of polymorphism. As a result the size of VNTR varies in size from 0.1 to 20 kb. Consequently, after hybridisation with VNTR probe, the autoradiogram gives many bands of differing sizes. These bands give a characteristic pattern for an individual DNA (Figure 6.16). It differs from individual to individual in a population except in the case of monozygotic (identical) twins. The sensitivity of the technique has been increased by</span> <span class="calibre7">use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR&ndash;you will study about it in Chapter 11). Consequently, DNA from a single cell is enough to perform DNA fingerprinting analysis. In addition to application in forensic science, it has much wider application, such as in determining population and genetic diversities. Currently, many different probes are used to generate DNA fingerprints.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">Nucleic acids are long polymers of nucleotides. While DNA stores genetic information, RNA mostly helps in transfer and expression of information. Though DNA and RNA both function as genetic material, but DNA being chemically and structurally more stable is a better genetic material. However, RNA is the first to evolve and DNA was derived from RNA. The hallmark of the double stranded helical structure of DNA is the hydrogen bonding between the bases from opposite strands. The rule is that Adenine pairs with Thymine through two H-bonds, and Guanine with Cytosine through three H-bonds. This makes one strand complementary to the other. The DNA replicates semiconservatively, the process is guided by the complementary H-bonding. A segment of DNA that codes for RNA may in a simplistic term can be referred as gene. During transcription also, one of the strands of DNA acts a template to direct the synthesis of complementary RNA. In bacteria, the transcribed mRNA is functional, hence can directly be translated. In eukaryotes, the gene is split. The coding sequences, exons, are interrupted by non-coding sequences, introns. Introns are removed and exons are joined to produce functional RNA by splicing. The messenger RNA contains the base sequences that are read in a combination of three (to make triplet genetic code) to code for an amino acid. The genetic code is read again on the principle of complementarity by tRNA that acts as an adapter molecule. There are specific tRNAs for every amino acid. The tRNA binds to specific amino acid at one end and pairs through H-bonding with codes on mRNA through its anticodons. The site of translation (protein synthesis) is ribosomes, which bind to mRNA and provide platform for joining of amino acids. One of the rRNA acts as a catalyst for peptide bond formation, which is an example of RNA enzyme (ribozyme). Translation is a process that has evolved around RNA, indicating that life began around RNA. Since, transcription and translation are energetically very expensive processes, these have to be tightly regulated. Regulation of transcription is the primary step for regulation of gene expression. In bacteria, more than one gene is arranged together and regulated in units called as operons.</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">Lac</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">operon is the prototype operon in bacteria, which codes for genes responsible for metabolism of lactose. The operon is regulated by the amount of lactose in the medium where the bacteria are grown. Therefore, this regulation can also be viewed as regulation of enzyme synthesis by its substrate.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">Human genome project was a mega project that aimed to sequence every base in human genome. This project has</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">yielded much new information. Many new areas and avenues have opened up as a consequence of the project. DNA Fingerprinting is a technique to find out variations in individuals of a population at DNA level. It works on the principle of polymorphism in DNA sequences. It has immense applications in the field of forensic science, genetic biodiversity and evolutionary biology.</span></p>
