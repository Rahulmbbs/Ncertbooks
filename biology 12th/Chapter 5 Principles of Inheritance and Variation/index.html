      <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">The work of Mendel and others who followed him gave us an idea of inheritance patterns. However the nature of those ‘factors’ which determine the phenotype was not very clear. As these ‘factors’ represent the genetic basis of inheritance, understanding the structure of genetic material and the structural basis of genotype and phenotype conversion became the focus of attention in biology for the next century. The entire body of molecular biology was a consequent development with major contributions from Watson, Crick, Nirenberg, Khorana, Kornbergs (father and son), Benzer, Monod, Brenner, etc. A parallel problem being tackled was the mechanism of evolution. Awareness in the areas of molecular genetics, structural biology and bio informatics have enriched our understanding of the molecular basis of evolution. In this unit the structure and function of DNA and the story and theory of evolution have been examined and explained.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4">James Dewey Watson was born in Chicago on 6 April 1928. In 1947, he received B.Sc. degree in Zoology. During these years his interest in bird-watching had matured into a serious desire to learn genetics. This became possible when he received a Fellowship for graduate study in Zoology at Indiana University, Bloomington, where he received his Ph.D. degree in 1950 on a study of the effect of hard X-rays on bacteriophage multiplication.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override1">He met Crick and discovered their common interest in solving the DNA structure. Their first serious effort, was unsatisfactory. Their second effort based upon more experimental evidence and better appreciation of the nucleic acid literature, resulted, early in March 1953, in the proposal of the complementary double-helical configuration.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Francis Harry Compton Crick was born on 8 June 1916, at Northampton, England. He studied physics at University College, London and obtained a B.Sc. in 1937. He completed Ph.D. in 1954 on a thesis entitled “X-ray Diffraction: Polypeptides and Proteins”.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">A critical influence in Crick’s career was his friendship with J. D. Watson, then a young man of 23, leading in 1953 to the proposal of the double-helical structure for DNA and the replication scheme. Crick was made an F.R.S. in 1959.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">The honours to Watson with Crick include: the John Collins Warren Prize of the Massachusetts General Hospital, in 1959; the Lasker Award, in 1960; the Research Corporation Prize, in 1962 and above all, the Nobel Prize in 1962.</p>

    <p class="calibre4">Have you ever wondered why an elephant always gives birth only to a baby elephant and not some other animal? Or why a mango seed forms only a mango plant and not any other plant?</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Given that they do, are the offspring identical to their parents? Or do they show differences in some of their characteristics? Have you ever wondered why siblings sometimes look so similar to each other? Or sometimes even so different?</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">These and several related questions are dealt with, scientifically, in a branch of biology known as Genetics. This subject deals with the inheritance, as well as the variation of characters from parents to offspring. Inheritance is the process by which characters are passed on from parent to progeny; it is the basis of heredity. Variation is the degree by which progeny differ from their parents.</p>

    <p class="calibre4"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">Humans knew from as early as 8000-1000 B.C. that one of the causes of variation was hidden in sexual reproduction. They exploited the variations that were naturally present in the wild populations of plants and animals to selectively breed and select for organisms that possessed desirable characters. For example, through</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">artificial selection and domestication from ancestral wild cows</span><span class="char-style-override1">, we have well-known Indian breeds, e.g., Sahiwal cows in Punjab. We must, however, recognise that though our ancestors knew about the inheritance of characters and variation, they had very little idea about the scientific basis of these phenomena.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-text-heading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">5.1 Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">It was during the mid-nineteenth century that headway was made in the understanding of inheritance. Gregor Mendel, conducted hybridi</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">sation experiments on garden peas for seven years (1856-1863) and proposed the laws of inheritance in living organisms. During Mendel’s investigations into inheritance patterns it was for the first time that statistical analysis and mathematical logic were applied to problems in biology. His experiments had a large sampling size, which gave greater credibility to the data that he collected. Also, the confirmation of his inferences from experiments on successive generations of his test plants, proved that his results pointed to general rules of inheritance rather than being unsubstantiated ideas. Mendel investigated characters in the garden pea plant that were manifested as two opposing traits, e.g., tall or dwarf plants, yellow or green seeds. This allowed him to set up a basic framework of rules governing inheritance, which was expanded on by later scientists to account for all the diverse natural observations and the complexity inherent in them.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Mendel conducted such artificial pollination/cross pollination experiments using several true-breeding pea lines. A true-breeding line is one that, having undergone continuous self-pollination, shows the stable trait inheritance and expression for several generations. Mendel selected 14 true-breeding pea plant varieties, as pairs which were similar except for one character with contrasting traits. Some of the contrasting traits selected were smooth or wrinkled seeds, yellow or green seeds, inflated (full) or constricted pods, green or yellow pods and tall or dwarf plants (Figure 5.1, Table 5.1).</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">Let us take the example of one such hybridisation experiment carried out by Mendel where he crossed tall and dwarf pea plants to study the inheritance of one gene (Figure 5.2). He collected the seeds produced as a result of this cross and grew them to generate plants of the first hybrid generation. This generation is also called the</span> <span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">Filial</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">1</span> <span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">progeny</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">or the</span> <span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">F</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">1</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">.

The tall and dwarf traits were identical to their parental type and did not show any blending, that is all the offspring were either tall or dwarf, none were of in-between height (Figure 5.3).</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">Similar results were obtained with the other traits that he studied: only one of the parental traits was expressed in the F</span><span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">1</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">generation while at the F</span><span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">2</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">stage both the traits were exp</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">ressed in the proportion 3:1.

    <p class="calibre4"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">Based on these observations, Mendel proposed that something was being stably passed down, unchanged, from parent to offspring through the gametes, over successive generations.

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">From the preceeding paragraphs it is clear that though the genotypic ratios can be calculated using mathematical probability, by simply looking at the phenotype of a dominant trait, it is not possible to know the genotypic composition.

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Let’s take an example of a gene that contains the information for producing an enzyme. Now there are two copies of this gene, the two allelic forms.

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">(ii) a non-functional enzyme, or</p>

Such equivalent allele pairs are very common. But, if the allele produces a non-functional enzyme or no enzyme, the phenotype may be effected. The phenotype/trait will only be dependent on the functioning of the unmodified allele. The unmodified (functioning) allele, which represents the original phenotype is the dominant allele and the modified allele is generally the recessive allele. Hence, in the example above the recessive trait is seen due to non-functional enzyme or because no enzyme is produced.</span></p>

Thirdly, Mendel’s approach of using mathematics to explain biological phenomena was totally new and unacceptable to many of the biologists of his time.

Recall that you have studied the behaviou</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">r of chromosomes during mitosis (equational division) and during meiosis (reduction division).

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">The mechanism of sex determination has always been a puzzle before the geneticists. The initial clue about the genetic/chromosomal mechanism of sex determination can be traced back to some of the experiments carried out in insects. In fact, the cytological observations made in a number of insects led to the development of the concept of genetic/chromosomal basis of sex-determination. Henking (1891) could trace a specific nuclear structure all through spermatogenesis in a few insects, and it was also observed by him that 50 per cent of the sperm received this structure after spermatogenesis, whereas the other 50 per cent sperm did not receive it. Henking gave a name to this structure as the</span> <span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">X body</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">but he could not explain its significance.

    <p class="calibre4"><span class="char-style-override1">These observations led to the investigation of a number of species to understand the mechanism of sex determination. In a number of other insects and mammals including man, XY type of sex determination is seen where both male and female have same number of chromosomes. Among the males an X-chromosome is present but its counter part is distinctly smaller and called the Y-chromosome. Females, however, have a pair of X-chromosomes. Both males and females bear same number of autosomes. Hence, the males have autosomes plus XY, while female have autosomes plus XX. In human beings and in</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">Drosophila</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">the males have one X and one Y chromosome, whereas females have a pair of X-chromosomes besides autosomes (</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">Figure 5.12 a, b).</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">It has already been mentioned that the sex determining mechanism in case of humans is XY type. Out of 23 pairs of chromosomes present, 22 pairs are exactly same in both males and females; these are the autosomes. A pair of X-chromosomes are present in the female, whereas the presence of an X and Y</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">chromosome are determinant of the male characteristic. During spermatogenesis among males, two types of gametes are produced. 50 per cent of the total sperm produced carry the X-chromosome and the rest 50 per cent has Y-chromosome besides the autosomes. Females, however, produce only one type of ovum with an X-chromosome. There is an equal probability of fertilisation of the ovum with the sperm carrying either X or Y chromosome. In case the ovum fertilises with a sperm carrying X-chromosome the zygote develops into a female (XX) and the fertilisation of ovum with Y-chromosome carrying sperm results into a male offspring. Thus, it is evident that it is the genetic makeup of the sperm that determines the sex of the child. It is also evident that in each pregnancy there is always 50 per cent probability of either a male or a female child. It is unfortunate that in our society women are blamed for giving birth to female children and have been ostracised and ill-treated because of this false notion.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-text-heading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">5.5 Mutation</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Mutation is a phenomenon which results in alteration of DNA sequences and consequently results in changes in the genotype and the phenotype of an organism. In addition to recombination, mutation is another phenomenon that leads to variation in DNA.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">As you will learn in Chapter 6, one DNA helix runs continuously from one end to the other in each chromatid, in a highly supercoiled form. Therefore loss (deletions) or gain (insertion/duplication) of a segment of DNA, result in alteration in chromosomes. Since genes are known to be located on chromosomes, alteration in chromosomes results in abnormalities or aberrations. Chromosomal aberrations are commonly observed in cancer cells.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">In addition to the above, mutation also arise due to change in a</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">single base pair of DNA. This is known as point mutation. A classical example of such a mutation is sickle cell anemia. Deletions and insertions of base pairs of DNA, causes frame-shift mutations (see Chapter 6).</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">The mechanism of mutation is beyond the scope of this discussion, at this level. However, there are many chemical and physical factors that induce mutations. These are referred to as mutagens. UV radiations can cause mutations in organisms &ndash; it is a mutagen.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">The idea that disorders are inherited has been prevailing in the human society since long. This was based on the heritability of certain characteristic features in families. After the rediscovery of Mendel’s work the practice of analysing inheritance pattern of traits in human beings began. Since it is evident that control crosses that can be performed in pea plant or some other organisms, are not possible in case of human beings, study of the family history about inheritance of a particular trait provides an alternative. Such an analysis of traits in a several of generations of a family is called the</span> <span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">pedigree analysis</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">. In the pedigree analysis the inheritance of a</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">particular trait is represented in the family tree over generations.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">In human genetics, pedigree study provides a strong tool, which is utilised to trace the inheritance of a specific trait, abnormality or disease. Some of the important standard symbols used in the pedigree analysis have been shown in Figure 5.13.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">As you have studied in this chapter, each and every feature in any organism is controlled by one or the other gene located on the DNA present in the chromosome. DNA is the carrier of genetic information. It is hence transmitted from one generation to the other without any change or alteration. However, changes or alteration do take place occasionally. Such an alteration or change in the genetic material is referred to as mutation. A number of disorders in human beings have been found to be associated with the inheritance of changed or altered genes or chromosomes.</p>

    <p class="chapter-text--subheading-70blac" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">5.6.2 Mendelian Disorders</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">Broadly, genetic disorders may be grouped into two categories &ndash; Mendelian disorders and Chromosomal disorders. Mendelian disorders are mainly determined by alteration or mutation in the single gene. These disorders are transmitted to the offspring on the same lines as we have studied in the principle of inheritance. The pattern of inheritance of such Mendelian disorders can be traced in a family by the pedigree analysis. Most common and prevalent Mendelian disorders are Haemophilia, Cystic fibrosis, Sickle-cell anaemia, Colour blindness, Phenylketonuria, Thalassemia, etc. It is important to mention here that such Mendelian disorders may be dominant or recessive. By pedigree analysis one can easily understand whether the trait in question is dominant or recessive. Similarly, the trait may also be linked to the sex chromosome as in case of haemophilia. It is evident that this X-linked recessive trait shows transmission from carrier</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">female to male progeny. A representative pedigree is shown in Figure 5.14</span> <span class="char-style-override1">for dominant and recessive traits. Discuss with your teacher and design pedigrees for characters linked to both autosomes and sex chromosome.</span></p>

In this disease, a single protein that is a part of the cascade of proteins involved in the clotting of blood is affected. Due to this, in an affected individual a simple cut will result in non-stop bleeding. The heterozygous female (carrier) for haemophilia may transmit the disease to sons. The possibility of a female becoming a haemophilic is extremely rare because mother of such a female has to be at least carrier and the father should be haemophilic (unviable in the later stage of life). The family pedigree of Queen Victoria shows a number of haemophilic descendents as she was a carrier of the disease.</span></p>

The substitution of amino acid in the globin protein results due to the single base substitution at the sixth codon of the beta globin gene from GAG to GUG. The mutant haemoglobin molecule undergoes polymerisation under low oxygen tension causing the change in the shape of the RBC from biconcave disc to elongated sickle like structure (Figure 5.15).</span></p><p class="h"><img alt="2005.png" class="frame4" src="images/000005.png" /></p>

These situations are known as trisomy or monosomy of a chromosome, respectively. Such a situation leads to very serious consequences in the individual. Down’s syndrome, Turner’s syndrome, Klinefelter’s syndrome are common examples of chromosomal disorders.</p>

      <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">Genetics is a branch of biology which deals with principles of inheritance and its practices. Progeny resembling the parents in morphological and physiolog</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">ical features has attracted the attention of many biologists. Mendel was the first to study this phenomenon systematically. While studying the pattern of inheritance in pea plants of contrasting characters, Mendel proposed the principles of inheritance, which are today referred to as ‘Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance’. He proposed that the ‘factors’ (later named as genes) regulating the characters are found in pairs known as alleles. He observed that the expression of the characters in the offspring follow a definite pattern in differen</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">t&ndash;</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">first generations (F</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">1</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">), second (F</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">2</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">) and so on. Some characters are dominant over others. The dominant characters are expressed when factors are in heterozygous condition (Law of Dominance). The recessive characters are only expressed in homozygous conditions. The characters never blend in heterozygous condition. A recessive character that was not expressed in heterozygous conditon may be expressed again when it becomes homozygous. Hence, characters segregate while formation of gametes (Law of Segregation).</span></p>

      <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Not all characters show true dominance. Some characters show incomplete, and some show co-dominance. When Mendel studied the inheritance of two characters together, it was found that the factors independently assort and combine in all permutations and combinations (Law of Independent Assortment). Different combinations of gametes are theoretically represented in a square tabular form known as ‘Punnett Square’. The factors (now known as gene) on chromosomes regulating the characters are called the genotype and the physical expression of the chraracters is called phenotype.</p>

      <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">After knowing that the genes are located on the chromosomes, a good correlation was drawn between Mendel’s laws : segregation and assortment of chromosomes during meiosis. The Mendel’s laws were extended in the form of ‘Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance’. Later, it was found that Mendel’s law of independent assortment does not hold true for the genes that were located on the same chromosomes. These genes were called as ‘linked genes’. Closely located genes assorted together, and distantly located genes, due to recombination, assorted independently. Linkage maps, therefore, corresponded to arrangement of genes on a chromosome.</p>

      <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">Many genes were linked to sexes also, and called as sex-linked genes. The two sexes (male and female) were found to have a set of chromosomes which were common, and another set which was different. The chromosomes which were different in two sexes were named as sex chromosomes. The remaining set was named as autosomes. In humans, a normal female has 22 pairs of autosomes</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">and a pair of sex chromosomes (XX). A male has 22 pairs of autosomes and a pair of sex chromosome as XY. In chicken, sex chromosomes in male are ZZ, and in females are ZW.</span></p>

      <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">Mutat</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">ion is defined as change in the genetic material. A point mutation is a change of a single base pair in DNA. Sickle-cell anemia is caused due to change of one base in the gene coding for beta-chain of hemoglobin. Inheritable mutations can be studied by generating a pedigree of a family. Some mutations involve changes in whole set of chromosomes (polyploidy) or change in a subset of chromosome number (aneuploidy). This helped in understanding the mutational basis of genetic disorders. Down’s syndrome is due to trisomy of chromosome 21, where there is an extra copy of chromosome 21 and consequently the total number of chromosome becomes 47. In Turner’s syndrome, one X chromosome is missing and the sex chromosome is as XO, and in Klinefelter’s syndrome, the condition is XXY. These can be easily studied by analysis of Karyotypes.</span></p>
