The whole approach to understanding natural phenomena became anthropocentric. Physics and chemistry gave rise to engineering, technologies and industries which all worked for human comfort and welfare. The major utility of the biological world is as a source of food. Biotechnology, the twentieth century off-shoot of modern biology, changed our daily life as its products brought qualitative improvement in health and food production. The basic principles underlying biotechnological processes and some applications are highlighted and discussed in this unit.</span></p>

He completed graduate work at the University of Pittsburgh, in 1963, followed by three years of post-graduate studies at Yale.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override">In 1966, Boyer took over assistant professorship at the University of California at San Francisco. By 1969, he performed studies on a couple of restriction enzymes of the</span> <span class="char-style-override2">E. coli</span> <span class="char-style-override">bacterium with especially useful properties. Boyer observed that these enzymes have the capability of cutting DNA strands in a particular fashion, which left what has became known as ‘sticky ends’ on the strands. These clipped ends made pasting together pieces of DNA a precise exercise.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override">This discovery, in turn, led to a rich and rewarding conversation in Hawaii with a Stanford scientist named Stanley Cohen. Cohen had been studying small ringlets of DNA called plasmids and which float about freely in the cytoplasm of certain bacterial cells and replicate independently from the coding strand of DNA. Cohen had developed a method of removing these plasmids from the cell and then reinserting them in other cells. Combining this process with that of DNA splicing enabled Boyer and Cohen to recombine segments of DNA in desired configurations and insert the DNA in bacterial cells, which could then act as manufacturing plants for specific proteins. This breakthrough was the basis upon which the discipline of biotechnology was founded.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-text-heading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">11.1 Principles of Biotechnology</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Among many, the two core techniques that enabled birth of modern biotechnology are :</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Let us now understand the conceptual development of the principles of genetic engineering.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">You probably appreciate the advantages of sexual reproduction over asexual reproduction. The former provides opportunities for variations and formulation of unique combinations of genetic setup, some of which may be beneficial to the organism as well as the population. Asexual reproduction preserves the genetic information, while sexual reproduction permits variation. Traditional hybridisation procedures used in plant and animal breeding, very often lead to inclusion and multiplication of undesirable genes along with the desired genes. The techniques of genetic engineering which include creation of</span> <b class="char-style-override2"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">recombinant DNA</span></b><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">, use of</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB"><b class="char-style-override2">gene cloning</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">and</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">gene transfer</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">, overcome this limitation and allows us to isolate and introduce only one or a set of desirable genes without introducing undesirable genes into the target organism.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Do you know the likely fate of a piece of DNA, which is somehow transferred into an alien organism? Most likely, this piece of DNA would not be able to multiply itself in the progeny cells of the organism. But, when it gets integrated into the genome of the recipient, it may multiply and be inherited along with the host DNA. This is because the alien piece of DNA has become part of a chromosome, which has the ability to replicate. In a chromosome there is a specific DNA sequence called the</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB"><b class="char-style-override2">origin of replication</b>,</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">which is responsible for initiating replication. Therefore, for the multiplication of any alien piece of DNA in an organism it needs to be a part of a chromosome(s) which has a specific sequence known as ‘origin of replication’. Thus, an alien DNA is linked with the origin of replication, so that, this alien piece of DNA can replicate and multiply itself in the host organism. This can also be called as</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">cloning</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">or making multiple identical copies of any template DNA.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Let us now focus on the first instance of the construction of an artificial recombinant DNA molecule. The construction of the first recombinant DNA emerged from the possibility of linking a gene encoding antibiotic resistance with a native</span> <b class="char-style-override2"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">plasmid</span></b> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">(autonomously replicating circular extra-chromosomal DNA) of</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">Salmonella typhimurium</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">. Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer accomplished this in 1972 by isolating the antibiotic resistance gene by cutting out a piece of DNA from a plasmid which was responsible for conferring antibiotic resistance. The cutting of DNA</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">at specific locations became po</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">s</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">sible with</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">the discovery of the so-called ‘molecular scissors’&ndash;</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB"><b class="char-style-override2">restriction enzymes</b></span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">. The cut piece of DNA was then linked with the plasmid DNA. These plasmid DNA act as</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB"><b class="char-style-override2">vectors</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">to transfer the piece of DNA attached to it. You probably know that mosquito acts as an insect vector to transfer the malarial parasite into human body. In the same way, a plasmid can be used as vector to deliver an alien piece of DNA into the host organism. The linking of antibiotic resistance gene with the plasmid vector became possible with the enzyme DNA ligase, which acts on cut DNA molecules and joins their ends. This makes a new combination of circular autonomously replicating DNA created</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">in vitro</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">and is known as recombinant DNA. When this DNA is transferred into</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">Escherichia coli</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">, a bacterium closely related to</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">Salmonella,</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">it could replicate using the new host’s DNA polymerase enzyme and make multiple copies. The ability to multiply copies of antibiotic resistance gene in</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">E. coli</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">was called</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB"><b class="char-style-override2">cloning</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">of antibiotic resistance gene in</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">E. coli</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">You can hence infer that there are three basic steps in genetically modifying an organism &mdash;</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">(i) identification of DNA with desirable genes;</p>

It was found that</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">Hind II</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">always cut DNA molecules at a particular point by recognising a specific sequence of six base pairs.

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">The convention for naming these enzymes is the first letter of the name comes from the genus and the second two letters come from the species of the prokaryotic cell from which t</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">hey</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">were isolated, e.g., EcoRI comes fr</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">om</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">E</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">s</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">cherichia coli</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">RY 13.

For example, you can ligate a foreign DNA at the BamH I site of tetracycline resistance gene in the vector pBR322. The recombinant plasmids will lose tetracycline resistance due to insertion of foreign DNA but can still be selected out from non-recombinant ones by plating the transformants on ampicillin containing medium. The transformants growing on ampicillin containing medium are then transferred on a medium containing tetracycline. The recombinants will grow in ampicillin containing medium but not on that containing tetracycline. But, non- recombinants will grow on the medium containing both the antibiotics. In this case, one antibiotic resistance gene helps in selecting the transformants, whereas the other antibiotic resistance gene gets ‘inactivated due to insertion’ of alien DNA, and helps in selection of recombinants.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Selection of recombinants due to inactivation of antibiotics is a cumbersome procedure because it requires simultaneous plating on two plates having different</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">antibiotics.

Let us examine each of these steps in some details.</span></p><p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override"><br class="calibre3" /></span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Recall that nucleic acid is the genetic material of all organisms without exception. In majority of organisms this is deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA. In order to cut the DNA with restriction enzymes, it needs to be in pure form, free from other macro-molecules. Since the DNA is enclosed within the membranes, we have to break the cell open to release DNA along with other macromolecules such as RNA, proteins, polysaccharides and also lipids. This can be achieved by treating the bacterial cells/plant or animal tissue with enzymes such as</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB"><b class="char-style-override2">lysozyme</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">(bacteria),</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB"><b class="char-style-override2">cellulase</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">(plant cells),</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB"><b class="char-style-override2">chitinase</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">(fungus). You know that genes are located on long molecules of DNA interwined with proteins such as histones. The RNA can be removed by treatment with ribonuclease whereas proteins can be removed by treatment with protease. Other molecules can be removed by appropriate treatments and purified DNA ultimately precipitates out after the addition of chilled ethanol. This can be seen as collection of fine threads in the suspension (Figure 11.5).</span></p><p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override"><br class="calibre3" /></span></p>
