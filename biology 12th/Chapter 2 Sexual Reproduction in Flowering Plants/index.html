    <p class="calibre4">Are we not lucky that plants reproduce sexually? The myriads of flowers that we enjoy gazing at, the scents and the perfumes that we swoon over, the rich colours that attract us, are all there as an aid to sexual reproduction. Flowers do not exist only for us to be used for our own selfishness. All flowering plants show sexual reproduction. A look at the diversity of structures of the inflorescences, flowers and floral parts, shows an amazing range of adaptations to ensure formation of the end products of sexual reproduction, the fruits and seeds. In this chapter, let us understand the morphology, structure and the processes of sexual reproduction in flowering plants (angiosperms).</p>

    <p class="calibre4">To a biologist, flowers are morphological and embryological marvels and the sites of sexual reproduction. In class XI, you have read the various parts of a flower. Figure 2.1 will help you recall the parts of a typical flower. Can you name the two parts in a flower in which the two most important units of sexual reproduction develop?</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Much before the actual flower is seen on a plant</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">, the decision that the plant is going to flower has taken place. Several hormonal and structural changes are initiated which lead to the differentiation and further development of the floral primordium. Inflorescences are formed which bear the floral buds and then the flowers. In the flower the male and female reproductive structures, the androecium and the gynoecium differentiate and develop. You would recollect that the androecium consists of a whorl of stamens representing the male reproductive organ and the gynoecium represents the female reproductive organ.</span></p>

Let us understand the various types of tissues and their organisation in the transverse section of an anther (Figure 2.3 a). The bilobed nature of an anther is very distinct in the transverse section of the anther. The anther is a four-sided (tetragonal) structure consisting of four</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">microsporangia</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">located at the corners, two in each lobe.</span></p>

It is generally surrounded by four wall layers (Figure 2.3 b)&ndash; the epidermis, endothecium, middle layers and the tapetum. The outer three wall layers perform the function of protection and help in dehiscence of anther to release the pollen. The innermost wall layer is the</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">tapetum.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">It nourishes the developing pollen grains. Cells of the tapetum possess dense cytoplasm and generally have more than one nucleus.</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Can you think of how tapetal cells could become bi-nucleate?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">When the anther is young, a group of compactly arranged homogenous cells called the</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">sporogenous tissue</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">occupies</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">the centre of each microsporangium.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Pollen grains are generally spherical measuring about 25-50 micrometers in diameter. It has a prominent two-layered wall. The hard outer layer called the</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">exine</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">is made up of sporopollenin which is one of the most resistant organic material known.

Pollen grain exine has prominent apertures called</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">germ pores</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">where sporopollenin is absent. Pollen grains are well-preserved as fossils because of the presence of sporopollenin.

    <p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Let us study formation of the embryo sac in a little more detail. (Figure 2.8b). The nucleus of the functional megaspore divides mitotically to form two nuclei which move to the opposite poles, forming the</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">2-nucleate</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">embryo sac.

It is of interest to note that these mitotic divisions are strictly free nuclear, that is, nuclear divisions are not followed immediately by cell wall formation. After the 8-nucleate stage, cell walls are laid down leading to the organisation of the typical</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">female gametophyte</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">or</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">embryo sac</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. Observe the distribution of cells inside the embryo sac (Figure 2.8b, c). Six of the eight nuclei are surrounded by cell walls and organised into cells; the remaining two nuclei, called polar nuclei are situated below the egg apparatus in the large</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">central cell.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">There is a</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">characteristic distribution of the cells within the embryo sac.

    <p class="chapter-text--subheading-70blac" lang="en-US">2.2.3 Pollination</p>

    <p lang="en-US" class="calibre4">In the preceding sections you have learnt that the male and female gametes in flowering plants are produced in the pollen grain and embryo sac, respectively. As both types of gametes are non-motile, they have to be brought together for fertilisation to occur. How is this achieved?</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Pollination</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">is the mechanism to achieve this objective. Transfer of pollen grains (shed from the anther) to the stigma of a pistil is termed</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">pollination</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. Flowering plants have evolved an amazing array of adaptations to achieve pollination</span><span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">They make use of external agents to achieve pollination.</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Can you list the possible external agents?</span></p>

    <p lang="en-US" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Kinds of Pollination :</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Depending on the source of pollen, pollination can be divided into three types.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">(i)</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Autogamy</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">:</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">In this type, pollination is achieved within the same flower. Transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of the same flower (Figure 2.9a). In a normal flower which opens and exposes the anthers and the stigma, complete autogamy is rather rare. Autogamy in such flowers requires synchrony in pollen release and stigma receptivity and also, the anthers and the stigma should</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">lie close to each other so that self-pollination can occur. Some plants such as</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Viola</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">(common pansy)</span><span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">, Oxalis,</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">and</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Commelina</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">produce two types of flowers &ndash;</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">chasmogamous</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">flowers which are similar to flowers of other species with exposed anthers and stigma, and</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">cleistogamous</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">flowers</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">which do not open at all (Figure 2.9c). In such flowers, the anthers and stigma lie close to each other. When anthers dehisce in the flower buds, pollen grains come in contact with the stigma to effect pollination. Thus, cleistogamous flowers are invariably autogamous as there is no chance of cross-pollen landing on the stigma. Cleistogamous flowers produce assured seed-set even in the absence of pollinators. Do you think that cleistogamy is advantageous or disadvantageous to the plant? Why?</span></p>

This is the only type of pollination which during pollination brings genetically different types of pollen grains to the stigma.</span></p>

    <p lang="en-US" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Agents of Pollination :</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Plants use two abiotic (wind and water) and one biotic (animals) agents to achieve pollination. Majority of plants use biotic agents for pollination. Only a small proportion of plants use abiotic agents. Pollen grains coming in contact with the stigma is a chance factor in both wind and water pollination. To compensate for this uncertainties and associated loss of pollen grains, the flowers produce enormous amount of pollen when compared to the number of ovules available for pollination.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Pollination by wind is more common amongst abiotic pollinations. Wind pollination also requires that the pollen grains are light and non-sticky so that they can be transported in wind currents. They often possess well-exposed stamens (so that the pollens are easily dispersed into wind currents, Figure 2.10) and large often-feathery stigma to easily trap air-borne pollen grains. Wind-pollinated flowers often have a single ovule in each ovary and numerous flowers packed into an inflorescence; a familiar example is the corn cob &ndash; the tassels you see are nothing but the stigma and style which wave in the wind to trap pollen grains. Wind-pollination is quite common in grasses.</p>

    <p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Pollination by water is quite rare in flowering plants and is limited to about 30 genera, mostly monocotyledons. As against this, you would recall that water is a regular mode of transport for the male gametes among the lower plant groups such as algae, bryophytes and pteridophytes. It is believed, particularly for some bryophytes and pteridophytes, that their distribution is limited because of the need for water for the transport of male gametes and fertilisation. Some examples of water pollinated plants are</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Vallisneria</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">and</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Hydrilla</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">which grow in fresh water and several marine sea-grasses such as</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Zostera</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. Not all aquatic plants use water for pollination. In a majority of aquatic plants such as water hyacinth and water lily, the flowers emerge above the level of water and are pollinated by insects or wind as in most of the land plants. In</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Vallisneria,</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">the female flower reach the surface of water by the long stalk and the male flowers or pollen grains are released on to the surface of water. They are carried passively by water currents (Figure 2.11a); some of them eventually reach the female flowers and the stigma. In another group of water pollinated plants such as seagrasses, female flowers remain submerged in water and the pollen grains are released inside the water. Pollen grains in many such species are long, ribbon like and they are carried passively inside the water; some of them reach the stigma and achieve pollination. In most of the water-pollinated species, pollen grains are protected from wetting by a mucilaginous covering.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Both wind and water pollinated flowers are not very colourful and do not produce nectar.</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">What would be the reason for this?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Majority of flowering plants use a range of animals as pollinating agents. Bees, butterflies, flies, beetles, wasps, ants, moths, birds (sunbirds and humming birds) and bats are the common pollinating agents. (Figure 2.1</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">1b). Among the animals, insects, particularly bees are the dominant biotic pollinating agents. Even larger animals such as some primates (lemurs), arboreal (tree-dwelling) rodents, or even reptiles (gecko lizard and garden lizard) have also been reported as pollinators in some species.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4">Often flowers of animal-pollinated plants are specifically adapted for a particular species of animal.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Majority of insect-pollinated flowers are large, colourful, fragrant and rich in nectar. When the flowers are small, a number of flowers are clustered into an inflorescence to make them conspicuous. Animals are attracted to flowers by colour and/or fragrance. The flowers pollinated by flies and beetles secrete foul odours to attract these animals. To sustain animal visits, the flowers have to provide rewards to the animals. Nectar and pollen grains are the usual floral rewards. For harvesting the reward(s) from the flower the animal visitor comes in contact with the anthers and the stigma. The body of the animal gets a coating of pollen grains, which are generally sticky in animal pollinated flowers. When the animal carrying pollen on its body comes in contact with the stigma, it brings about pollination.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">In some species floral rewards are in providing safe places to lay eggs; an example is that of the tallest flower of</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Amorphophallus</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">(the flower itself is about 6 feet in height). A similar relationship exists between a species of moth and the plant</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Yucca</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">where both species &ndash; moth and the</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">plant &ndash; cannot complete their life cycles without each other. The moth deposits its eggs in the locule of the ovary and the flower, in turn, gets pollinated by the moth.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">The larvae of the moth come out of the eggs as the seeds start developing.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Why don’t you observe some flowers of the following plants (or any</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">others available to you): Cucumber, Mango, Peepal, Coriander, Papaya, Onion, Lobia, Cotton, Tobacco, Rose, Lemon, Eucalyptus, Banana</span><span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">? Try to find out which animals visit them and whether they could be pollinators.You’ll have to patiently observe the flowers over a few days and at different times of the day. You could also try to see whether there is any correlation in the characteristics of a flower to the animal that visits it. Carefully observe if any of the visitors come in contact with the anthers and the stigma as only such visitors can bring about pollination. Many insects may consume pollen or the nectar without bringing about pollination. Such floral visitors are referred to as pollen/nectar robbers. You may or may not be able to identify the pollinators, but you will surely enjoy your efforts!</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Outbreeding Devices</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">:</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Majority of flowering plants produce hermaphrodite flowers and pollen grains are likely to come in contact with the stigma of the same flower. Continued self-pollination result in inbreeding depression. Flowering plants have developed many devices to disco</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">urage self-pollination and to encourage cross-pollination. In some species, pollen release and stigma receptivity are not synchronised. Either the pollen is released before the stigma becomes receptive or stigma becomes receptive much before the release of pollen. In some other species, the anther and stigma are placed at different positions so that the pollen cannot come in contact with the stigma of the same flower. Both these devices prevent autogamy. The third device to prevent inbreeding is self-incompatibility. This is a genetic mechanism and prevents self-pollen (from the same flower or other flowers of the same plant) from fertilising the ovules by inhibiting pollen germination or pollen tube growth in the pistil. Another device to prevent self-pollination is the production of unisexual flowers. If both male and female flowers are present on the same plant such as castor and maize (monoecious), it prevents autogamy but not geitonogamy. In several species such as papaya, male and female flowers are present on different plants, that is each plant is either male or female (dioecy). This condition prevents both autogamy and geitonogamy.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Pollen-pistil Interaction :</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Pollination does not guarantee the transfer of the right type of pollen (compatible pollen of the same species as the stigma). Often, pollen of the wrong type, either from other species or from the same plant (if it is self-incompatible), also land on the stigma. The pistil has the ability to recognise the pollen, whether it is of the right type (compatible) or of the wrong type (incompatible). If it is of the right type,</span> <span class="calibre6">the pistil accepts the pollen and promotes post-pollination events that leads to fertilisation. If the pollen is of the wrong type, the pistil rejects the pollen by preventing pollen germination on the stigma or the pollen tube growth in the style. The ability of the pistil to recognise the pollen followed by its acceptance or rejection is the result of a continuous dialogue between pollen grain and the pistil. This dialogue is mediated by chemical components of the pollen interacting with those of the pistil. It is only in recent years that botanists have been able to identify some of the pollen and pistil components and the interactions leading to the recognition, followed by acceptance or rejection.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">As mentioned earlier, following compatible pollination, the pollen grain germinates on the stigma to produce a pollen tube through one of the</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">germ pores (Figure 2.12a). The contents of the pollen grain move into the</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">pollen tube. Pollen tube grows through the tissues of the stigma and style and reaches the ovary (Figure 2.12b, c). You would recall that in some plants, pollen grains are shed at two-celled condition (a vegetative cell and a generative cell). In such plants, the generative cell divides and forms the two male gametes during the growth of pollen tube in the stigma. In plants which shed pollen in the three-celled condition, pollen tubes carry the two male gametes from the beginning. Pollen tube, after reaching the ovary, enters the ovule through the micropyle and then enters one of the synergids through the filiform apparatus (Figure 2.12d, e). Many recent studies have shown that filiform apparatus present at the micropylar part of the synergids guides the entry of pollen tube. All these events&ndash;from pollen deposition on the stigma until pollen tubes enter the ovule</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">&ndash;</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">are together referred to as pollen-pistil interaction. As pointed out earlier, pollen-pistil interaction is a dynamic process involving pollen recognition followed by promotion or inhibition of the pollen. The knowledge gained in this area would help the plant breeder in manipulating pollen-pistil interaction, even in incompatible pollinations, to get desired hybrids.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">You can easily study pollen germination by dusting some pollen from flowers such as pea, chickpea,</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Crotalaria</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">, balsam and</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Vinca</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">on a glass slide containing a drop of sugar solution (about 10 per cent). After about 15&ndash;30 minutes, observe the slide under the low power lens of the microscope. You are likely to see pollen tubes coming out of the pollen grains.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">As you shall learn in the chapter on plant breeding (Chapter 9), a breeder is interested in crossing different species and often genera to combine desirable characters to produce commercially ‘superior’ varieties.</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Artificial hybridisation</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">is one of the major approaches of crop improvement programme. In such crossing experiments it is important to make sure that only the desired pollen grains are used for pollination and the stigma is protected from contamination (from unwanted pollen). This is achieved by emasculation and bagging techniques.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">If the female parent bears bisexual flowers, removal of anthers from the flower bud before the anther dehisces using a pair of forceps is necessary. This step is referred to as</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">emasculation</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. Emasculated flowers have to be covered with a bag of suitable size, generally made up of butter paper, to prevent contamination of its stigma with unwanted pollen. This process is called</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">bagging</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. When the stigma of bagged flower attains receptivity, mature pollen grains collected from anthers of the male parent are dusted on the stigma, and the flowers are rebagged, and the fruits allowed to develop.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">If the female parent produces unisexual flowers, there is no need for emasculation. The female flower buds are bagged before the flowers open. When the stigma becomes receptive, pollination is carried out using the desired pollen and the flower rebagged.</span></p>

The cells of this tissue are filled with reserve food materials and are used for the nutrition of the developing embryo. In the most common type of endosperm development, the PEN undergoes successive nuclear divisions to give rise to free nuclei. This stage of endosperm development is called free-nuclear endosperm. Subsequently cell wall formation occurs and the endosperm becomes cellular. The number of free nuclei formed before cellularisation varies greatly. The coconut water from tender coconut that you are familiar with, is nothing but free-nuclear endosperm (made up of thousands of nuclei) and the surrounding white kernel is the cellular endosperm.</span></p>

Though the seeds differ greatly, the early stages of embryo development</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">(embryogeny)</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">are similar in both monocotyledons and dicotyledons.

      <p lang="en-US" class="calibre4"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">In angiosperms, the seed is the final product of sexual reproduction. It is often described as a fertilised ovule. Seeds are formed inside fruits. A seed typically consists of seed coat(s), cotyledon(s) and an embryo axis. The cotyledons (Figure 2.15a) of the embryo are simple structures, generally thick and swollen due to storage of food reserves (as in legumes). Mature seeds may be</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">non-albuminous</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">or</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">albuminous</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. Non-albuminous seeds have no residual endosperm as it is completely consumed during embryo development (e.g., pea, groundnut, sunflower). Albuminous seeds retain a part of endosperm as it is not completely used up during embryo development (e.g., wheat, maize, barley, castor). Occasionally, in some seeds such as black pepper and beet, remnants of nucellus are also persistent. This residual, persistent nucellus is the</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">perisperm.</span></p>

      <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Integuments of ovules harden as tough protective seed coats (Figure 2.15a). The micropyle remains as a small pore in the seed coat. This facilitates entry of oxygen and water into the seed during germination. As the seed matures, its water content is reduced and seeds become relatively dry (10-15 per cent moisture by mass). The general metabolic activity of the embryo slows down. The embryo may enter a state of inactivity called</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">dormancy,</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">or if favourable conditions are available (adequate moisture, oxygen and suitable temperature),</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">they germinate.</span></p>

      <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">As ovules mature into seeds, the ovary develops into a fruit, i.e., the transformation of ovules into seeds and ovary into fruit proceeds simultaneously. The wall of the ovary develops into the wall of fruit called</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">pericarp</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. The fruits may be fleshy as in guava, orange, mango, etc., or may be dry, as in groundnut, and mustard, etc. Many fruits have evolved mechanisms for dispersal of seeds. Recall the classification of fruits and their dispersal mechanisms that you have studied in an earlier class.</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Is there any relationship between number of ovules in an ovary and the number of seeds present in a fruit?</span></p>

      <p class="calibre4"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">In most plants, by the time the fruit develops from the ovary, other floral parts degenerate and fall off. However, in a few species such as apple, strawberry, cashew, etc., the thalamus also contributes to fruit formation. Such fruits are called</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">false fruits</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">(Figure 2.15b). Most fruits however develop only from the ovary and are called</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">true fruits</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. Although in most of the species, fruits are the results of fertilisation, there are a few species in which fruits develop without fertilisation. Such fruits are called</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">parthenocarpic</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">fruits.</span> <span class="calibre6">Banana is one such example. Parthenocarpy can be induced through the application of growth hormones and such fruits are seedless.</span></p>

      <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Seeds offer several advantages to angiosperms. Firstly, since reproductive processes such as pollination and fertilisation are independent of water, seed formation is more dependable. Also seeds have better adaptive strategies for dispersal to new habitats and help the species</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">to colonise in other areas. As they have sufficient food reserves, young seedlings are nourished until they are capable of photosynthesis on their own. The hard seed coat provides protection to the young embryo. Being products of sexual reproduction, they generate new genetic combinations leading to variations.</span></p>

      <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Seed is the basis of our agriculture. Dehydration and dormancy of mature seeds are crucial for storage of seeds which can be used as food throughout the year and also to raise crop in the next season. Can you imagine agriculture in the absence of seeds, or in the presence of seeds which germinate straight away soon after formation and cannot be stored?</p>

      <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">How long do the seeds remain alive after they are dispersed? This period again varies greatly. In a few species the seeds lose viability within a few months. Seeds of a large number of species live for several years. Some seeds can remain alive for hundreds of years. There are several records of very old yet viable seeds. The oldest is that of a lupine,</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Lupinus arcticus</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">excavated from Arctic Tundra. The seed germinated and flowered after an estimated record of 10,000 years of dormancy. A recent record of 2000 years old viable seed is of the date palm,</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Phoenix dactylifera</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">discovered during the archeological excavation at King Herod’s palace near the Dead Sea.</span></p>

      <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">After completing a brief account of sexual reproduction of flowering plants it would be worth attempting to comprehend the enormous reproductive capacity of some flowering plants by asking the following questions:</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">How many eggs are present in an embryo sac? How many embryo sacs are present in an ovule? How many ovules are present in an ovary? How many ovaries are present in a typical flower? How many flowers are present on a tree? And so on...</span></p>

      <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Can you think of some plants in which fruits contain very large number of seeds. Orchid fruits are one such category and each fruit contain thousands of tiny seeds. Similar is the case in fruits of some parasitic species such as Orobanche and Striga.</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Have you seen a tiny seed of Ficus? How large is the tree of Ficus developed from that tiny seed. How many billions of seeds does each Ficus tree produce? Can you imagine any other example in which such a tiny structure can produce such a large biomass over the years?</span></p>

      <p lang="en-US" class="calibre4"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Although seeds, in general are the products of fertilisation, a few flowering plants such as some species of</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Asteraceae</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">and grasses, have evolved a special mechanism, to produce seeds without fertilisation, called</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">apomixis.</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">What is fruit production without fertilisation called?</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Thus, apomixis is a form of asexual reproduction that mimics sexual reproduction. There are several ways of development of apomictic seeds. In some species, the diploid egg cell is formed without reduction division and develops into the embryo without fertilisation. More often, as in many</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Citrus</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">and</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Mango</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">varieties some of the nucellar cells surrounding the embryo sac start dividing, protrude into the embryo sac and develop into the embryos. In such species each ovule contains many embryos. Occurrence of more than one embryo in a seed is referred to as</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">polyembryony</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">.</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-GB">Take out some seeds of orange and squeeze them. Observe the many embryos of different sizes and shapes from each seed. Count the number of embryos in each seed. What would be the genetic nature of apomictic embryos? Can they be called clones?</span></p>

      <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Hybrid varieties of</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">several of our food and vegetable crops are being extensively cultivated. Cultivation of hybrids has tremendously increased productivity. One of the problems of hybrids is that hybrid seeds have to be produced every year. If the seeds collected from hybrids are sown, the plants in the progeny will segregate and do not maintain hybrid characters. Production of hybrid seeds is costly and hence the cost of hybrid seeds become too expensive for the farmers. If these hybrids are made into apomicts, there is no segregation of characters in the hybrid progeny. Then the farmers can keep on using the hybrid seeds to raise new crop year after year and he does not have to buy hybrid seeds every year. Because of the importance of apomixis in hybrid seed industry, active research is going on in many laboratories around the world to understand the genetics of apomixis and to transfer apomictic genes into hybrid varieties.</span></p><br class="calibre3" />

          <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">A typical anther is bilobed, dithecous and tetrasporangiate. Pollen grains develop inside the microsporangia. Four wall layers, the epidermis, endothecium, middle layers and the tapetum surround the microsporangium. Cells of the sporogenous tissue lying in the centre of the microsporangium, undergo meiosis (microsporogenesis) to form tetrads of microspores. Individual microspores mature into pollen grains.</p>

          <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Pollen grains represents the male gametophytic generation. The pollen grains have a two-layered wall, the outer exine and inner intine. The exine is made up of sporopollenin and has germ pores. Pollen grains may have two cells (a vegetative cell and generative cell) or three cells (a vegetative cell and two male gametes) at the time of shedding.</p>

          <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">The pistil has three parts &ndash; the stigma, style and the ovary. Ovules are present in the ovary. The ovules have a stalk called funicle, protective integument(s), and an opening called micropyle. The central tissue is the nucellus in which the archesporium differentiates. A cell of the archesporium, the megaspore mother cell divides meiotically and one of the megaspores forms the embryo sac (the female gametophyte). The mature embryo sac is 7-celled and 8-nucleate. At the micropylar end is the egg apparatus consisting of two synergids and an egg cell. At the chalazal end are three antipodals. At the centre is a large central cell with two polar nuclei.</p>

          <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Pollination is the mechanism to transfer pollen grains from the anther to the stigma. Pollinating agents are either abiotic (wind and water) or biotic (animals).</p>

          <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Pollen-pistil interaction involves all events from the landing of pollen grains on the stigma until the pollen tube enters the embryo sac (when the pollen is compatible) or pollen inhibition (when the pollen is incompatible). Following compatible pollination, pollen grain germinates on the stigma and the resulting pollen tube grow through the style, enter the ovules and finally discharges two male gametes in one of the synergids. Angiosperms exhibit double fertilisation because two fusion events occur in each embryo sac, namely syngamy and triple fusion. The products of these fusions are the diploid zygote and the triploid primary endosperm nucleus (in the primary endosperm cell). Zygote develops into the embryo and the primary endosperm cell forms the endosperm tissue. Formation of endosperm always precedes development of the embryo.</p>

          <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">The developing embryo passes through different stages such as the proembryo, globular and heart-shaped stages before maturation. Mature dicotyledonous embryo has two cotyledons and an embryonal axis with epicotyl and hypocotyl. Embryos of monocotyledons have a single cotyledon. After fertilisation, ovary develops into fruit and ovules develop into seeds.</p>

          <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">A phenomenon called apomixis is found in some angiosperms, particularly in grasses. It results in the formation of seeds without fertilisation. Apomicts have several advantages in horticulture and agriculture.</p>

          <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Some angiosperms produce more than one embryo in their seed. This phenomenon is called polyembryony.</span></p>
