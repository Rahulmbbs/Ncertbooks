    <p class="normal1">1.1 <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-US">What is physics ?</span></p>

    <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">Humans have always been curious about the world around them. The night sky with its bright celestial objects has fascinated humans since time immemorial. The regular repetitions of the day and night, the annual cycle of seasons, the eclipses, the tides, the volcanoes, the rainbow have always been a source of wonder. The world has an astonishing variety of materials and a bewildering diversity of life and behaviour. The inquiring and imaginative human mind has responded to the wonder and awe of nature in different ways. One kind of response from the earliest times has been to observe the physical environment carefully, look for any meaningful patterns and relations in natural phenomena, and build and use new tools to interact with nature. This human endeavour led, in course of time, to modern science and technology.</span></p>

    <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">The word</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-US">Science</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">originates from the Latin verb</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">Scientia</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">meaning</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">‘</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">to know</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">’</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">. The Sanskrit word</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">Vijnan</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">and the Arabic word</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">Ilm</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">convey similar meaning, namely ‘knowledge’. Science, in a broad sense, is as old as human species. The early civilisations of Egypt, India, China, Greece, Mesopotamia and many others made vital contributions to its progress. From the sixteenth century onwards, great strides were made in science in Europe. By the middle of the twentieth century, science had become a truly international enterprise, with many cultures and countries contributing to its rapid growth.</span></p>

    <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">What is Science and what is the so-called</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-US">Scientific Metho</span><span class="calibre5" lang="en-US">d</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">? Science is a systematic attempt to understand natural phenomena in as much detail and depth as possible, and use the knowledge so gained to predict, modify and control phenomena. Science is exploring, experimenting and predicting from what we see around us. The curiosity to learn about the world, unravelling the secrets of nature is the first step towards the discovery of science. The scientific method involves several interconnected steps : Systematic observations, controlled experiments, qualitative and</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">quantitative reasoning, mathematical modelling, prediction and verification or falsification of theories. Speculation and conjecture also have a place in science; but ultimately, a scientific theory, to be acceptable, must be verified by relevant observations or experiments. There is much philosophical debate about the nature and method of science that we need not discuss here.</span></p>

    <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">The interplay of theory and observation (or experiment) is basic to the progress of science. Science is ever dynamic. There is no ‘final’ theory in science and no unquestioned authority among scientists. As observations improve in detail and precision or experiments yield new results, theories must account for them, if necessary, by introducing modifications. Sometimes the modifications may not be drastic and may lie within the framework of existing theory. For example, when Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) examined the extensive data on planetary motion collected by Tycho Brahe (1546-1601), the planetary circular orbits in heliocentric theory (sun at the centre of the solar system) imagined by Nicolas Copernicus (1473&ndash;1543) had to be replaced by elliptical orbits to fit the data better. Occasionally, however, the existing theory is simply unable to explain new observations. This causes a major upheaval in science. In the beginning of the twentieth century, it was realised that Newtonian mechanics, till then a very successful theory, could not explain some of the most basic features of atomic phenomena. Similarly, the then accepted wave picture of light failed to explain the photoelectric effect properly. This led to the development of a radically new theory (</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">Quantum Mechanics</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">) to deal with atomic and molecular phenomena.</span></p>

    <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">Just as a new experiment may suggest an alternative theoretical model, a theoretical advance may suggest what to look for in some experiments. The result of experiment of scattering of alpha particles by gold foil, in 1911 by Ernest Rutherford (1871&ndash;1937) established the nuclear model of the atom, which then became the basis of the quantum theory of hydrogen atom given in 1913 by Niels Bohr (1885&ndash;1962). On the other hand, the concept of antiparticle was first introduced theoretically by Paul Dirac (1902&ndash;1984) in 1930 and confirmed two years later by the experimental discovery of</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">positron (antielectron) by Carl Anderson.</span></p>

    <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">Physics is a basic discipline in the category of</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-US">Natural Sciences</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">,</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">which also includes other disciplines like Chemistry and Biology. The word</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-US">Physics</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">comes from a Greek word meaning nature. Its Sanskrit equivalent is</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">Bhautiki</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">that is used to refer to the study of the physical world. A precise definition of this discipline is neither possible nor necessary. We can broadly describe physics as a study of the basic laws of nature and their manifestation in different natural phenomena. The scope of physics is described briefly in the next section. Here we remark on t</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">wo principal</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">thrusts in physics :</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-US">unification</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">and</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-US">reduction</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">.</span></p>

    <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">In Physics, we attempt to explain diverse physical phenomena</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">in</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">terms of a few concepts and laws</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">.</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">The effort is to see the physical world as manifestation of some universal laws in different domains and conditions. For example, the same law of gravitation (given by Newton) describes the fall of an apple to the ground, the motion of the moon around the earth and the motion of planets around the sun. Similarly, the basic laws of electromagnetism (Maxwell’s equations) govern all electric and magnetic phenomena. The attempts to unify fundamental forces of nature (section 1.4) reflect this same quest for unification.</span></p>

    <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">A related effort is to derive the properties of a bigger, more complex, system from the properties and interactions of its constituent simpler parts. This approach is called</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-US">reductionism</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">and is at the heart of physics. For example, the subject of thermodynamics, developed in the nineteenth century, deals with bulk systems in terms of macroscopic quantities such as temperature, internal energy, entropy, etc. Subsequently, the subjects of kinetic theory and statistical mechanics interpreted these quantities in terms of the properties of the molecular constituents of t</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">he bulk system. In particular, the</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">temperature was seen to be related to the average kinetic energy of molecules of the system.</span></p>

    <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">We can get some idea of the scope of physics by</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">looking at its various sub-disciplines. Basically, there are two domains of interest : macroscopic and microscopic. The macroscopic domain includes phenomena at the laboratory, terrestrial and astronomical scales. The microscopic domain includes atomic, molecular and nuclear</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">phenomena</span><span class="char-style-override6" lang="en-US">*</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">.</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-US">Classical Physics</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">deals mainly with macroscopic phenomena and includes subjects like</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-US">Mechanics</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">,</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-US">Electrodynamics, Optics</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">and</span> <span class="calibre5" lang="en-US">Thermodynamics</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">. Mechanics founded on Newton’s laws of motion and the law of gravitation is concerned with the motion (or equilibrium) of particles, rigid and deformable bodies, and general systems of particles. The propulsion of a rocket by a jet of ejecting gases, propagation of water waves or sound waves in air, the equilibrium of a bent rod under a load, etc., are problems of mechanics. Electrodynamics deals with electric and magnetic phenomena associated with charged and magnetic bodies. Its basic laws were given by Coulomb, Oersted,</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">Ampere and Faraday, and encapsulated by Maxwell in his</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">famous set of equations. The motion of a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field, the response of a circuit to an ac voltage (signal), the working of an antenna, the propagation of radio waves in the ionosphere, etc., are problems of electrodynamics. Optics deals with the phenomena involving light. The working of telescopes and microscopes, colours exhibited by thin films, etc., are topics in optics. Thermodynamics, in contrast to mechanics, does not deal with the motion of bodies as a whole. Rather, it deals with systems in macroscopic equilibrium and is concerned with changes in internal energy, temperature, entropy, etc., of the system through external work and transfer of heat. The efficiency of heat engines and refrigerators, the direction of a physical or</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">chemical process, etc., are problems of interest in thermodynamics.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override1">The microscopic domain of physics deals with the constitution and structure of matter at the minute scales of atoms and nuclei (and even lower scales of length) and their interaction with different probes such as electrons, photons and other elementary particles. Classical physics is inadequate to handle this domain and Quantum Theory is currently accepted as the proper framework for explaining microscopic phenomena. Overall, the edifice of physics is beautiful and imposing and you will appreciate it more as you pursue the subject.</span></p>

    <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">You can now see that the scope of physics is truly vast. It covers a tremendous range of magnitude of physical quantities like length, mass, time, energy, etc. At one end, it studies phenomena at the very small scale of length (10</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">-14</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">m or even less) involving electrons, protons, etc.; at the other end, it deals with astronomical phenomena at the scale of galaxies or even the entire universe whose extent is of the order of 10</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">26</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">m. The two length scales differ by a factor of 10</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">40</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">or even more. The range of time scales can be obtained by dividing the length scales by the speed of light : 10</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">&ndash;22</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">s to 10</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">18</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">s. The range of masses goes from, say, 10</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">&ndash;30</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">kg (mass of an electron) to 10</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">55</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">kg (mass of known observable universe).

    </div>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override1">Physics is exciting in many ways. To some people the excitement comes from the elegance and universality of its basic theories, from the fact that a few basic concepts and laws can explain phenomena covering a large range of magnitude of physical quantities. To some others, the challenge in carrying out imaginative new experiments to unlock the secrets of nature, to verify or refute theories, is thrilling. Applied physics is equally demanding. Application and exploitation of physical laws to make useful devices is the most interesting and exciting part and requires great ingenuity and persistence of effort.</span></p>

    <div class="lining_box">
      <p class="calibre4" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override3">Hypothesis, axioms and models</span></p>

      <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override2">One should not think that everything can be proved with physics and mathematics. All physics, and also mathematics, is based on assumptions, each of which is variously called a hypothesis or axiom or postulate, etc.</span></p>

      <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override2">For example, the universal law of gravitation proposed by Newton is an assumption or hypothesis, which he proposed out of his ingenuity. Before him, there were several observations, experiments and data, on the motion of planets around the sun, motion of the moon around the earth, pendulums, bodies falling towards the earth etc. Each of these required a separate explanation, which was more or less qualitative. What the universal law of gravitation says is that,</span> <span class="char-style-override8">if we assume</span> <span class="char-style-override2">that any two bodies in the universe attract each other with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, then we can explain all these observations in one stroke. It not only explains these phenomena, it also allows us to predict the results of future experiments.</span></p>

      <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override2">A hypothesis is a supposition without assuming that it is true. It would not be fair to ask anybody to prove the universal law of gravitation, because it cannot be proved. It can be verified and substantiated by experiments and observations.</span></p>

      <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override2">An axiom is a self-evident truth while a model is a theory proposed to explain observed phenomena. But you need not worry at this stage about the nuances in using these words. For example, next year you will learn about Bohr’s model of hydrogen atom, in which Bohr assumed that an electron in the hydrogen atom follows certain rules (postutates). Why did he do that? There was a large amount of spectroscopic data before him which no other theory could explain. So Bohr said that if we assume that an atom behaves in such a manner, we can explain all these things at once.</span></p>

      <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override2">Einstein’s special theory of relativity is also based on two postulates, the constancy of the speed of electromagnetic radiation and the validity of physical laws in all inertial frame of reference. It would not be wise to ask somebody to prove that the speed of light in vacuum is constant, independent of the source or observer.</span></p>

      <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override2">In mathematics too, we need axioms and hypotheses at every stage. Euclid’s statement that parallel lines never meet, is a hypothesis. This means that if we assume this statement, we can explain several properties of straight lines and two or three dimensional figures made out of them. But if you don’t assume it, you are free to use a different axiom and get a new geometry, as has indeed happened in the past few centuries and decades.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"></p>

    <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">What lies behind the phenomenal progress of physics in the last few centuries? Great progress usually accompanies changes in our basic perceptions. First, it was realised that for scientific progress, only qualitative thinking, though no doubt important, is not enough. Quantitative measurement is central to the growth of science, especially physics, because the laws of nature happen to be expressible in precise mathematical equations. The second most important insight was that the basic laws of physics are</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">universal</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">&mdash; the same laws apply in widely different contexts. Lastly, the strategy of approximation turned out to be very successful. Most observed phenomena in daily life are rather complicated manifestations of the basic laws. Scientists recognised the importance of extracting the essential features of a phenomenon from its less significant aspects. It is not practical to take into account all the complexities of a phenomenon in one go.</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">A good strategy is to focus first on the essential features,</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">discover the basic principles and then introduce corrections to build a more refined theory of the phenomenon. For example, a stone and a feather dropped from the same height do not reach the ground at the same time. The reason is that the essential aspect of the phenomenon, namely free fall under gravity, is complicated by the presence of air resistance. To get the law of free fall under gravity, it is better to create a situation wherein the air resistance is negligible. We can, for example, let the stone and the feather fall through a long evacuated tube. In that case, the two objects will fall almost at the same rate, giving the basic law that acceleration due to gravity is independent of the mass of the object. With the basic law thus found, we can go back to the feather, introduce</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">corrections due to air resistance, modify the existing theory and try to build a more realistic theory of objects falling to the earth under gravity.</span></p>

    <p class="normal1" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-US"><br class="calibre3" /></span></p><p class="normal1" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-US">1.3</span> <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-US">Physics, technology and society</span></p>

    <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">The connection between physics, technology and society can be seen in many examples. The discipline of thermodynamics arose from the need to understand and improve the working of heat engines. The steam engine, as we know, is inseparable from the Industrial Revolution in England in the eighteenth century, which had great impact on the course of human civilisation. Sometimes technology gives rise to new physics; at other times physics generates new technology. An example of the latter is the wireless communication technology that followed the discovery of the basic laws of electricity and magnetism in the nineteenth century. The applications of physics are not always easy to foresee. As late as 1933, the great physicist Ernest Rutherford had dismissed the possibility of tapping energy from atoms. But only a few years later, in 1938, Hahn and Meitner discovered the phenomenon of neutron-induced fission of uranium, which would serve as the basis of nuclear power reactors and nuclear weapons. Yet another important example of physics giving rise to technology is the silicon ‘chip’ that triggered the computer revolution in</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">the last three decades of the twentieth century.</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">A most significant area to which physics has</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">and will contribute is the development of alternative energy resources. The fossil fuels of the planet are dwindling fast and there is an urgent need to discover new and affordable sources of energy. Considerable progress has already been made in this direction (for example, in conversion of solar energy, geothermal energy, etc., into electricity), but much more is still to be accomplished.</span></p>

Going from this intuitive notion to the proper scientific concept of force is not a trivial matter. Early thinkers like Aristotle had wrong ideas about it. The correct notion of force was arrived at by Isaac Newton in his famous</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">laws of m</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">otion. He also gave an explicit form for the force for gravitational attraction between two bodies. We shall learn these matters in subsequent chapters.</span></p>

      <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-US">Albert Einstein, born in Ulm, Germany in 1879, is universally regarded as one of the greatest physicists of all time. His astonishing scientific career began with the publication of three path-breaking papers in 1905. In the first paper, he introduced the notion of light quanta (now called photons) and used it to explain the features of photoelectric effect that the classical wave theory of radiation could not account for. In the second paper, he developed a theory of Brownian motion that was confirmed experimentally a few years later and provided a convincing evidence of the atomic picture of matter. The third paper gave birth to the special theory of relativity that made Einstein a legend in his own life time. In the next decade, he explored the consequences of his new theory which included, among other things, the mass-energy equivalence enshrined in his famous equation E = mc</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">2</span><span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-US">. He also created the general version of relativity (The General Theory of Relativity), which is the modern theory of gravitation. Some of Einstein’s most significant later contributions are: the notion of stimulated emission introduced in an alternative derivation of Planck’s blackbody radiation law, static model of the universe which started modern cosmology, quantum statistics of a gas of massive bosons, and a critical analysis of the foundations of quantum mechanics. The year 2005 was declared as International Year of Physics, in recognition of Einstein’s monumental contribution to physics, in year 1905, describing revolutionary scientific ideas that have since influenced all of modern physics.</span></p>

    <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">Electromagnetic force is the force between charged particles. In the simpler case when charges are at rest, the force is given by Coulomb’s law : attractive for unlike charges and repulsive for like charges</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">.</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">Charges in motion produce magnetic effects and a magnetic field gives rise to a force on a moving charge. Electric and magnetic effects are, in general, inseparable</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">&ndash; hence the name electromagnetic force. Like the gravitational force, electromagnetic force acts over large distances and does not need any intervening medium. It is enormously strong compared to gravity. The</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">electric force between two protons, for example, is 10</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">36</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">times the gravitational force between them, for any fixed distance.</span></p>

    <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">Matter, as we know, consists of elementary charged constituents like electrons and protons. Since the electromagnetic force is so much stronger than the gravitational force, it dominates all phenomena at atomic and molecular scales. (The other two forces, as we shall see, operate only at nuclear scales.) Thus it is mainly the electromagnetic force that governs the structure of atoms and molecules, the dynamics of chemical reactions and the mechanical, thermal and other properties of materials. It underlies the macroscopic forces like ‘tension’, ‘friction’, ‘normal force’, ‘spring force’, et</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">c.</span></p>

This is what makes all the difference. Matter is mostly electrically neutral (net charge is zero). Thus, electric force is largely zero and gravitational force dominates terrestrial phenomena.

      <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-US">Satyendranath Bose, born in Calcutta in 1894, is among the great Indian physicists who made a fundamental contribution to the advance of science in the twentieth century. An outstanding student throughout, Bose started his career in 1916 as a lecturer in physics in Calcutta University; five years later he joined Dacca University. Here in 1924, in a brilliant flash of insight, Bose gave a new derivation of Planck’s law, treating radiation as a gas of photons and employing new statistical methods of counting of photon states. He wrote a short paper on the subject and sent it to Einstein who immediately recognised its great significance, translated it in German and forwarded it for publication. Einstein then applied the same method to a gas of molecules.</span></p>

      <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-US">The key new conceptual ingredient in Bose’s work was that the particles were regarded as indistinguishable, a radical departure from the assumption that underlies the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics. It was soon realised that the new Bos</span><span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-US">e</span><span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-US">-Einstein statistics was applicable to particles with integers spins, and a new quantum statistics (Fermi-Dirac statistics) was needed for particles with half integers spins satisfying Pauli’s exclusion principle. Particles with integers spins are now known as bosons in honour of Bose.</span></p>

      <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"></p>

      <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-US">An important consequence of Bose-Einstein statistics is that a gas of molecules below a certain temperature will undergo a phase transition to a state where a large fraction of atoms populate the same lowest energy state. Some seventy years were to pass before the pioneering ideas of Bose, developed further by Einstein, were dramatically confirmed in the observation of a new state of matter in a dilute gas of ultra cold alkali atoms - the Bose-Eintein condensate.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">Conservation laws have a deep connection with symmetries of nature that you will explore in more advanced courses in physics. For example, an important observation is that the laws of nature do not change with time! If you perform an experiment in your laboratory today and repeat the same experiment (on the same objects under identical conditions) after a year, the results are bound to be the same. It turns out that this symmetry of nature with respect to translation (i.e. displacement) in time is equivalent to the law of conservation of energy. Likewise, space is homogeneous and there is no (intrinsically) preferred location in the universe.

      <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override2">Conservation of energy, momentum, angular momentum, charge, etc are considered to be fundamental laws in physics. At this moment, there are many such conservation laws. Apart from the above four, there are others which mostly deal with quantities which have been introduced in nuclear and particle physics. Some of the conserved quantities are called spin, baryon number, strangeness, hypercharge, etc, but you need not worry about them.</span></p>

      <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override2">A conservation law is a hypothesis, based on observations and experiments. It is important to remember that a conservation law cannot be proved. It can be verified, or disproved, by experiments. An experiment whose result is in conformity with the law verifies or substantiates the law; it does not prove the law. On the other hand, a single experiment whose result goes against the law is enough to disprove it.</span></p>

      <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override2">It would be wrong to ask somebody to prove the law of conservation of energy. This law is an outcome of our experience over several centuries, and it has been found to be valid in all experiments, in mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, optics, atomic and nuclear physics, or any other area.</span></p>

      <p class="normal" lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override2">Some students feel that they can prove the conservation of mechanical energy from a body falling under gravity, by adding the kinetic and potential energies at a point and showing that it turns out to be constant.

There are four fundamental forces in nature that govern the diverse phenomena of the macroscopic and the microscopic world. These are the ‘gravitational force’, the ‘electromagnetic force’, the ‘strong nuclear force’, and the ‘weak nuclear force’.

Some of the general conservation laws in nature include the laws of conservation of mass, energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, charge, parity, etc. Some conservation laws are true for one fundamental force but not for the other.</span></p>
