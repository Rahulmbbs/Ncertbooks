    <p class="text">All of us breathe to live, but why is breathing so essential to life? What happens when we breathe? Also, do all living organisms, including plants and microbes, breathe? If so, how?</p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US">All living organisms need energy for carrying out daily life activities, be it absorption, transport, movement, reproduction or even breathing. Where does all this energy come from? We know we eat food for energy &ndash; but how is this energy taken from food? How is this energy utilised? Do all foods give the same amount of energy? Do plants ‘eat’? Where do plants get their energy from? And micro-organisms &ndash; for their energy requirements, do they eat ‘food’?</p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US">You may wonder at the several questions raised above &ndash; they may seem to be very disconnected. But in reality, the process of breathing is very much connected to the process of release of energy from food. Let us try and understand how this happens.</p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">All the energy required for ‘life’ processes is obtained by oxidation of some macromolecules that we call ‘food’. Only green plants and cyanobacteria can prepare their own food; by the process of photosynthesis they trap light energy and convert it into chemical energy that is stored in the bonds of carbohydrates like glucose, sucrose and starch. We must remember that in green plants too, not all cells, tissues and organs photosynthesise; only cells containing chloroplasts, that are most often located in the superficial layers, carry out photosynthesis. Hence, even in green plants all other organs, tissues and cells that are non-green, need food for oxidation. Hence, food has to be translocated to all non-green parts. Animals are heterotrophic, i.e., they obtain food from plants directly (herbivores) or indirectly (carnivores). Saprophytes like fungi are dependent on dead and decaying matter. What is important to recognise is that ultimately all the food that is respired for life processes comes from photosynthesis. This chapter deals with</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">cellular respiration</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">or the mechanism of breakdown of food materials within the cell to release energy, and the trapping of this energy for synthesis of ATP.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Photosynthesis, of course, takes place within the chloroplasts (in the eukaryotes), whereas the breakdown of complex molecules to yield energy takes place in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondria (also only in eukaryotes). The breaking of the C-C bonds of complex compounds through oxidation within the cells, leading to release of considerable amount of energy is called</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">respiration</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. The compounds that are oxidised during this process are known as</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">respiratory substrates.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Usually carbohydrates are oxidised to release energy, but proteins, fats and even organic acids can be used as respiratory substances in some plants, under certain conditions. During oxidation within a cell, all the energy contained in respiratory substrates is not released free into the cell, or in a single step. It is released in a series of slow step-wise reactions controlled by enzymes, and it is trapped as chemical energy in the form of ATP. Hence, it is important to understand that the energy released by oxidation in respiration is not (or rather cannot be) used directly but is used to synthesise ATP, which is broken down whenever (and wherever) energy needs to be utilised. Hence, ATP acts as the energy currency of the cell. This energy trapped in ATP is utilised in various energy-requiring processes of the organisms, and the carbon skeleton produced during respiration is used as precursors for biosynthesis of other molecules in the cell.</span></p>

    <p class="conceptheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">14.1 Do Plants Breathe?</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Well, the answer to this question is not quite so direct. Yes, plants require O</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre7">2</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">for respiration to occur and they also give out CO</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre7">2</sub></span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. Hence, plants have systems in place that ensure the availability of O</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre7">2</sub></span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. Plants, unlike animals, have no specialised organs for gaseous exchange but they have stomata and lenticels for this purpose. There are several reasons why plants can get along without respiratory organs. First, each plant part takes care of its own gas-exchange needs. There is very little transport of gases from one plant part to another. Second, plants do not present great demands for gas exchange. Roots, stems and leaves respire at rates far lower than animals do. Only during photosynthesis are large volumes of gases exchanged and, each leaf is well adapted to take care of its own needs during these periods. When cells photosynthesise, availability of O</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">2</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">is not a problem in these cells since O</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre7">2</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">is released within the cell. Third, the distance that gases must diffuse even in large, bulky plants is not great. Each living cell in a plant is located quite close to the surface of the plant. ‘This is true for leaves’, you may ask, ‘but what about thick, woody stems and roots?’ In stems, the ‘living’ cells are organised in thin layers inside and beneath the bark. They also have openings called lenticels. The cells in the interior are dead and provide only mechanical support. Thus, most cells of a plant have at least a part of their surface in contact with air. This is also facilitated by the loose packing of parenchyma cells in leaves, stems and roots, which provide an interconnected network of air spaces.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">The complete combustion of glucose, which produces CO</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre7">2</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">and H</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre7">2</sub></span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">O as end products, yields energy most of which is given out as heat.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6"><img alt="2090.png" class="frame" src="images/000007.png" /></span>&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US">If this energy is to be useful to the cell, it should be able to utilise it to synthesise other molecules that the cell requires. The strategy that the plant cell uses is to catabolise the glucose molecule in such a way that not all the liberated energy goes out as heat. The key is to oxidise glucose not in one step but in several small steps enabling some steps to be just large enough such that the energy released can be coupled to ATP synthesis. How this is done is, essentially, the story of respiration.</p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">During the process of respiration, oxygen is utilised, and carbon dioxide, water and energy are released as products. The combustion reaction requires oxygen. But some cells live where oxygen may or may not be available.</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Can you think of such situations (and organisms) where O</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre7">2</sub></span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">is not available?</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">There are sufficient reasons to believe that the first cells on this planet lived in an atmosphere that lacked oxygen. Even among present-day living organisms, we know of several that are adapted to anaerobic conditions. Some of these organisms are facultative anaerobes, while in others the requirement for anaerobic condition is obligate. In any case, all living organisms retain the enzymatic machinery to partially oxidise glucose without the help of oxygen. This breakdown of glucose to pyruvic acid is called</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">glycolysis.</span></p>

    <p class="conceptheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">14.2 Glycolysis</span></p>

    <p class="text"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">The term glycolysis has originated from the Greek words,</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">glycos</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">for sugar, and</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">lysis</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">for splitting. The scheme of glycolysis was given by Gustav Embden, Otto Meyerhof, and J. Parnas, and is often referred to as the EMP pathway. In anaerobic organisms, it is the only process in respiration. Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and is present in all living organisms. In this process, glucose undergoes partial oxidation to form two molecules of pyruvic acid. In plants, this glucose is derived from sucrose, which is the end product of photosynthesis, or from storage</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">carbohydrates. Sucrose is converted into glucose and fructose by the enzyme, invertase, and these two monosaccharides readily enter the glycolytic pathway. Glucose and fructose are phosphorylated to give rise to glucose-6-phosphate by the activity of the enzyme hexokinase. This phosphorylated form of glucose then isomerises to produce</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">fructose-6-phosphate. Subsequent steps of metabolism of glucose and fructose are same. The various steps of glycolysis are depicted in Figure 14.1. In glycolysis, a chain of ten reactions, under the control of different enzymes, takes place to produce pyruvate from glucose.

There are three major ways in which different cells handle pyruvic acid produced by glycolysis. These are lactic acid fermentation, alcoholic fermentation and aerobic respiration.

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">When the electrons pass from one carrier to another via complex I to IV in the electron transport chain, they are coupled to ATP synthase (complex V) for the production of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. The number of ATP molecules synthesised depends on the nature of the electron donor. Oxidation of one molecule of NADH gives rise to 3 molecules of ATP, while that of one molecule of FADH</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre7">2</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">produces 2 molecules of ATP. Although the aerobic process of respiration takes place only in the presence of oxygen, the role of oxygen is limited to the terminal stage of the process. Yet, the presence of oxygen is vital, since it drives the whole process by removing hydrogen from the system. Oxygen acts as the final hydrogen acceptor. Unlike photophosphorylation where it is the light energy that is utilised for the production of proton gradient required for phosphorylation, in respiration it is the energy of oxidation-reduction utilised for the same process. It is for this reason that the process is called oxidative phosphorylation.</span></p>

    <p class="text"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">You have already studied about the mechanism of membrane-linked ATP synthesis as explained by chemiosmotic hypothesis in the earlier chapter. As mentioned earlier, the energy released during the electron transport system is utilised in synthesising ATP with the help of ATP synthase (complex V).

    <p class="text" lang="en-US">It is possible to make calculations of the net gain of ATP for every glucose molecule oxidised; but in reality this can remain only a theoretical exercise. These calculations can be made only on certain assumptions that:</p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">•</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">There is a sequential, orderly pathway functioning, with one substrate forming the next and with glycolysis, TCA cycle and ETS pathway following one after another.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">•</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">The NADH synthesised in glycolysis is transferred into the mitochondria and undergoes oxidative phosphorylation.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">•</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">None of the intermediates in the pathway are utilised to synthesise any other compound.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">•</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Only glucose is being respired &ndash; no other alternative substrates are entering in the pathway at any of the intermediary stages.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">But this kind of assumptions are not really valid in a living system; all pathways work simultaneously and do not take place one after another; substrates enter the pathways and are withdrawn from it as and when necessary; ATP is utilised as and when needed; enzymatic rates are controlled by multiple means. Yet, it is useful to do this exercise to appreciate the beauty and efficiency of the living system in extraction and storing energy. Hence, there can be a net gain of 36 ATP molecules during aerobic respiration of one molecule of glucose.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US">Now let us compare fermentation and aerobic respiration:</p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">•</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Fermentation accounts for only a partial breakdown of glucose whereas in aerobic respiration it is completely degraded to CO</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre7">2</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">and H</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre7">2</sub></span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">O.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">•</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">In fermentation there is a net gain of only two molecules of ATP for each molecule of glucose degraded to pyruvic acid whereas many more molecules of ATP are generated under aerobic conditions.</span></p>

    <p class="conceptheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">14.6 Amphibolic Pathway</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US">Glucose is the favoured substrate for respiration. All carbohydrates are usually first converted into glucose before they are used for respiration. Other substrates can also be respired, as has been mentioned earlier, but then they do not enter the respiratory pathway at the first step. See Figure 14.6 to see the points of entry of different substrates in the respiratory pathway. Fats would need to be broken down into glycerol and fatty acids first. If fatty acids were to be respired they would first be degraded to acetyl CoA and enter the pathway. Glycerol would enter the pathway after being converted to PGAL. The proteins would be degraded by proteases and the individual amino acids (after deamination) depending on their structure would enter the pathway at some stage within the Krebs’ cycle or even as pyruvate or acetyl CoA.</p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Since respiration involves breakdown of substrates, the respiratory process has traditionally been considered a catabolic process and the respiratory pathway as a catabolic pathway. But is this understanding correct? We</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">have discussed above, at which points in the respiratory pathway different substrates would enter if they were to be respired and used to derive energy. What is important to recognise is that it is these very compounds that would be withdrawn from the respiratory pathway for the synthesis of the said substrates. Hence, fatty acids would be broken down to acetyl CoA before entering the respiratory pathway when it is used as a substrate. But when the organism needs to synthesise fatty acids, acetyl CoA would be withdrawn from the respiratory pathway for it. Hence, the respiratory pathway comes into the picture both during breakdown and synthesis of fatty acids. Similarly, during breakdown and synthesis of protein too, respiratory intermediates form the link. Breaking down processes within the living organism is catabolism, and synthesis is anabolism. Because the respiratory pathway is involved in both anabolism and catabolism, it would hence be better to consider the respiratory pathway as an</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">amphibolic pathway</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">rather than as a catabolic one.</span></p>

      <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">The breaking of C-C bonds of complex organic molecules by oxidation cells leading to the release of a lot of energy is called cellular respiration. Glucose is the favoured substrate for respiration. Fats and proteins can also be broken down to yield energy. The initial stage of cellular respiration takes place in the cytoplasm. Each glucose molecule is broken through a series of enzyme catalysed reactions into two molecules of pyruvic acid. This process is called glycolysis. The fate of the pyruvate depends on the availability of oxygen and the organism. Under anaerobic conditions either lactic acid fermentation or alcohol fermentation occurs. Fermentation takes place under anaerobic conditions in many prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes and in germinating seeds. In eukaryotic organisms aerobic respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen. Pyruvic acid is transported into the mitochondria where it is converted into acetyl CoA with the release of CO</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre9">2</sub></span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">.
