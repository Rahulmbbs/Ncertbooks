    <p class="text"><span class="calibre6">Movement is one of the significant features of living beings. Animals and plants exhibit a wide range of movements. Streaming of protoplasm in the unicellular organisms like</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Amoeba</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">is a simple form of movement. Movement of cilia, flagella and tentacles are shown by many organisms. Human beings can move limbs, jaws, eyelids, tongue, etc. Some of the movements result in a change of place or location. Such voluntary movements are called</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">locomotion</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. Walking, running, climbing, flying, swimming are all some forms of locomotory movements. Locomotory structures need not be different from those affecting other types of movements. For example, in</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Paramoecium</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">, cilia helps in the movement of food through cytopharynx and in locomotion as well.</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Hydra</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">can use its tentacles for capturing its prey and also use them for locomotion. We use limbs for changes in body postures and locomotion as well. The above observations suggest that movements and locomotion cannot be studied separately. The two may be linked by stating that all locomotions are movements but all movements are not locomotions.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Methods of locomotion performed by animals vary with their habitats and the demand of the situation. However, locomotion is generally for search of food, shelter, mate, suitable breeding grounds, favourable climatic conditions or to escape from enemies/predators.</span></p>

    <p class="conceptheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override1">20.1 Types of Movement</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US">Cells of the human body exhibit three main types of movements, namely, amoeboid, ciliary and muscular.</p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Some specialised cells in our body like macrophages and leucocytes in blood exhibit amoeboid movement. It is effected by pseudopodia formed by the streaming of protoplasm (as in</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Amoeba</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">). Cytoskeletal elements like microfilaments are also involved in amoeboid movement.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US">Ciliary movement occurs in most of our internal tubular organs which are lined by ciliated epithelium. The coordinated movements of cilia in the trachea help us in removing dust particles and some of the foreign substances inhaled alongwith the atmospheric air. Passage of ova through the female reproductive tract is also facilitated by the ciliary movement.</p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US">Movement of our limbs, jaws, tongue, etc, require muscular movement. The contractile property of muscles are effectively used for locomotion and other movements by human beings and majority of multicellular organisms. Locomotion requires a perfect coordinated activity of muscular, skeletal and neural systems. In this chapter, you will learn about the types of muscles, their structure, mechanism of their contraction and important aspects of the skeletal system.</p>

    <p class="conceptheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override1">20.2 Muscle</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US">Muscle is a specialised tissue of mesodermal origin. About 40-50 per cent of the body weight of a human adult is contributed by muscles. They have special properties like excitability, contractility, extensibility and elasticity. Muscles have been classified using different criteria, namely location, appearance and nature of regulation of their activities. Based on their location, three types of muscles are identified : (i) Skeletal (ii) Visceral and (iii) Cardiac.</p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Skeletal muscles</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">are closely associated with the skeletal components of the body. They have a striped appearance under the microscope and hence are called</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">striated</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">muscles</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. As their activities are under the voluntary control of the nervous system, they are known as voluntary muscles too. They are primarily involved in locomotory actions and changes of body postures.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Visceral muscles</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">are located in the inner walls of hollow visceral organs of the body like the alimentary canal, reproductive tract, etc. They do not exhibit any striation and are smooth in appearance. Hence, they are called</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">smooth muscles (nonstriated muscle)</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. Their activities are not under the voluntary control of the nervous system and are therefore known as involuntary muscles. They assist, for example, in the transportation of food through the digestive tract and gametes through the genital tract.</span></p>

    <p class="text"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">As the name suggests,</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Cardiac muscles</span> <span class="calibre6">are the muscles of heart. Many cardiac muscle cells assemble in a branching pattern to form a cardiac muscle. Based on appearance, cardiac muscles are striated. They are involuntary in nature as the nervous system does not control their activities directly.</span></p>

    <p class="text"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Let us examine a skeletal muscle in detail to understand the structure and mechanism of contraction. Each organised skeletal muscle in our body is made of a number of</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">muscle bundles</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">or</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">fascicles</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">held together by a common collagenous connective tissue layer called</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">fascia</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Each muscle bundle</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">contains a number of muscle fibres (Figure 20.1). Each muscle fibre is lined by the plasma membrane called sarcolemma enclosing the sarcoplasm. Muscle fibre is a syncitium as the sarcoplasm contains many nuclei. The endoplasmic reticulum, i.e., sarcoplasmic reticulum of the muscle fibres is the store house of calcium ions. A characteristic feature of the muscle fibre is the presence of a large number of parallelly arranged filaments in the sarcoplasm called myofilaments or</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">myofibrils</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. Each myofibril has alternate dark and light bands on it. A detailed study of the myofibril has established that the striated appearance is due to the distribution pattern of two important proteins &ndash;</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Actin</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">and</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Myosin</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. The light bands contain actin and is called I-band or Isotropic band, whereas the dark band called ‘A’ or Anisotropic</span> <span class="calibre6">band contains myosin. Both the proteins are arranged as rod-like structures, parallel to each other and also to the longitudinal axis of the myofibrils. Actin filaments are thinner as compared to the myosin filaments, hence are commonly called thin and thick filaments respectively. In the centre of each ‘I’ band is an elastic fibre called ‘Z’ line which bisects it. The thin filaments are firmly attached to the ‘Z’ line. The thick filaments in the<br class="calibre3" />
    ‘A’ band are also held together in the middle of this band by a thin fibrous membrane called ‘M’ line. The ‘A’ and ‘I’ bands are arranged alternately throughout the length of the myofibrils. The portion of the myofibril between two successive ‘Z’ lines is considered as the functional unit of contraction and is called a sarcomere (Figure 20.2). In a resting state, the edges of thin filaments on either side of the thick filaments partially overlap the free ends of the thick filaments leaving the central part of the thick filaments. This central part of thick filament, not overlapped by thin filaments is called the ‘H’ zone.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US">Each actin (thin) filament is made of two ‘F’ (filamentous) actins helically wound to each other. Each ‘F’ actin is a polymer of monomeric ‘G’ (Globular) actins. Two filaments of another protein, tropomyosin also run close to the ‘F’ actins throughout its length. A complex protein Troponin is distributed at regular intervals on the tropomyosin. In the resting state a subunit of troponin masks the active binding sites for myosin on the actin filaments (Figure 20.3a).</p>

The HMM component</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">, i.e.; the head and short arm projects outwards at regular distance and angle from each other from the surface of a polymerised myosin filament and is known as cross arm.

    <p class="text"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Muscle contraction is initiated by a signal sent by the central nervous system (CNS) via a motor neuron. A motor neuron alongwith the muscle fibres connected to it constitute a motor unit. The junction between a motor neuron and the sarcolemma of the muscle fibre is called the neuromuscular junction or motor-end plate. A neural signal reaching this junction releases a neurotransmitter (Acetyl choline) which generates an action potential in the sarcolemma. This spreads through the muscle fibre and causes the release of calcium ions into the sarcoplasm. Increase in Ca</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">++</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">level leads to the binding of calcium with a subunit of troponin on actin filaments and thereby remove the masking of active sites for myosin. Utilising the energy from ATP hydrolysis, the myosin head now binds to the exposed active sites on actin to form a cross bridge (Figure 20.4). This pulls the attached actin filaments towards the centre of ‘A’ band. The&nbsp;‘Z’ line attached to these actins are also pulled inwards thereby causing a shortening of the sarcomere, i.e., contraction. It is clear from the above steps, that during shortening of the muscle, i.e., contraction, the ‘I’ bands get reduced, whereas the ‘A’ bands retain the length (Figure 20.5). The myosin, releasing the ADP and P</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">1</span> <span class="calibre6">goes back to its relaxed state. A new</span></p>

    <p class="text"><span class="calibre6">ATP binds and the cross-bridge is broken (Figure 20.4).

The process continues till the Ca</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre7">++</sup></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">ions are pumped back to the sarcoplasmic cisternae resulting in the masking of actin filaments. This causes the return of ‘Z’ lines back to their original position, i.e., relaxation. The reaction time of the fibres can vary in different muscles. Repeated activation of the muscles can lead to the accumulation of lactic acid due to anaerobic breakdown of glycogen in them, causing fatigue. Muscle contains a red coloured oxygen storing pigment called myoglobin. Myoglobin content is high in some of the muscles which gives a reddish appearance. Such muscles are called the Red fibres. These muscles also contain plenty of mitochondria which can utilise the large amount of oxygen stored in them for ATP production. These muscles, therefore, can also be called aerobic muscles. On the other hand, some of the muscles possess very less quantity of myoglobin and therefore, appear pale or whitish. These are the White fibres. Number of mitochondria are also few in them, but the amount of sarcoplasmic reticulum is high. They depend on anaerobic process for energy.</span></p>

    <p class="conceptheading"><span class="char-style-override1">20.3 Skeletal System</span></p>

    <p class="text"><span class="calibre6">Skeletal system consists of a framework of bones and a few cartilages. This system has a significant role in movement shown by the body. Imagine chewing food without jaw bones and walking around without the limb bones. Bone and cartilage are specialised connective tissues. The former has a very hard matrix due to calcium salts in it and the latter has slightly pliable matrix due to chondroitin salts. In human beings, this system is made up of 206 bones and a few cartilages. It is grouped into two principal divisions &ndash; the axial and the appendicular skeleton.<br class="calibre3" /></span></p>

Each girdle is formed of two halves. Each half of pectoral girdle consists of a clavicle and a scapula (Figure 20.9). Scapula is a large triangular flat bone situated in the dorsal part of the thorax between the second and the seventh ribs. The dorsal, flat, triangular body of scapula has a slightly elevated ridge called the spine which projects as a flat, expanded process called the acromion. The clavicle articulates with this. Below the acromion is a depression called the glenoid cavity which articulates with the head of the humerus to form the shoulder joint. Each clavicle is a long slender bone with two curvatures. This bone is commonly called the collar bone.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Pelvic girdle consists of two coxal bones (Figure 20.10). Each coxal bone is formed by the fusion of three bones &ndash; ilium, ischium and pubis. At the point of fusion of the above bones is a cavity called acetabulum to which the thigh bone articulates. The two halves of the pelvic girdle meet ventrally to form the pubic symphysis containing fibrous cartilage.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US">Joints are essential for all types of movements involving the bony parts of the body. Locomotory movements are no exception to this. Joints are points of contact between bones, or between bones and cartilages. Force generated by the muscles is used to carry out movement through joints, where the joint acts as a fulcrum. The movability at these joints vary depending on different factors. Joints have been classified into three major structural forms, namely, fibrous, cartilaginous and synovial.</p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Fibrous joints</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">do not allow any movement. This type of joint is shown by the flat skull bones which fuse end-to-end with the help of dense fibrous connective tissues in the form of sutures, to form the cranium.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">In</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">cartilaginous joints,</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">the bones involved are joined together with the help of cartilages. The joint between the adjacent vertebrae in the vertebral column is of this pattern and it permits limited movements.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Synovial joints</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">are characterised by the presence of a fluid filled synovial cavity between the articulating surfaces of the two bones. Such an arragement allows considerable movement. These joints help in locomotion and many other movements. Ball and socket joint (between humerus and pectoral girdle), hinge joint (knee joint), pivot joint (between atlas and axis), gliding joint (between the carpals) and saddle joint (between carpal and metacarpal of thumb) are some examples.</span></p>

      <p class="subheading1" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override1">Summary</span></p>

      <p class="text" lang="en-US">Movement is an essential feature of all living beings. Protoplasmic streaming, ciliary movements, movements of fins, limbs, wings, etc., are some forms exhibited by animals. A voluntary movement which causes the animal to change its place, is called locomotion. Animals move generally in search of food, shelter, mate, breeding ground, better climate or to protect themselves.</p>

      <p class="text" lang="en-US">The cells of the human body exhibit amoeboid, ciliary and muscular movements. Locomotion and many other movements require coordinated muscular activities. Three types of muscles are present in our body. Skeletal muscles are attached to skeletal elements. They appear striated and are voluntary in nature. Visceral muscles, present in the inner walls of visceral organs are nonstriated and involuntary. Cardiac muscles are the muscles of the heart. They are striated, branched and involuntary. Muscles possess excitability, contractility, extensibility and elasticity.</p>

      <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Muscle fibre is the anatomical unit of muscle. Each muscle fibre has many parallelly arranged myofibrils. Each myofibril contains many serially arranged units called sarcomere which are the functional units. Each sarcomere has a central ‘A’ band made of thick myosin filaments, and two half ‘I’ bands made of thin actin filaments on either side of it marked by ‘Z’ lines. Actin and myosin are polymerised proteins with contractility. The active sites for myosin on resting actin filament are masked by a protein-troponin. Myosin head contains ATPase and has ATP binding sites and active sites for actin. A motor neuron carries signal to the muscle fibre which generates an action potential in it. This causes the release of Ca</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre9">++</sup></span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">from sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre9">++</sup></span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">activates actin which binds to the myosin head to form a cross bridge. These cross bridges pull the actin filaments causing them to slide over the myosin filaments and thereby causing contraction. Ca</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre9">++</sup></span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">are then returned to sarcoplasmic reticulum which inactivate the actin. Cross bridges are broken and the muscles relax.</span></p>

      <p class="text" lang="en-US">Repeated stimulation of muscles leads to fatigue. Muscles are classified as Red and White fibres based primarily on the amount of red coloured myoglobin pigment in them.</p>

      <p class="text" lang="en-US">Bones and cartilages constitute our skeletal system. The skeletal system is divisible into axial and appendicular. Skull, vertebral column, ribs and sternum constitute the axial skeleton. Limb bones and girdles form the appendicular skeleton. Three types of joints are formed between bones or between bone and cartilage &ndash; fibrous, cartilaginous and synovial. Synovial joints allow considerable movements and therefore, play a significant role in locomotion.</p>
