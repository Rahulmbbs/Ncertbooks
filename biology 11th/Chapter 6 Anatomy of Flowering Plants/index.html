    <p class="chapter-index">You can very easily see the structural similarities and variations in the external morphology of the larger living organism, both plants and animals. Similarly, if we were to study the internal structure, one also finds several similarities as well as differences. This chapter introduces you to the internal structure and functional organisation of higher plants. Study of internal structure of plants is called anatomy. Plants have cells as the basic unit, cells are organised into tissues and in turn the tissues are organised into organs. Different organs in a plant show differences in their internal structure. Within angiosperms, the monocots and dicots are also seen to be anatomically different. Internal structures also show adaptations to diverse environments.</p>

    <p class="conceptheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override1">6.1 The Tissues</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">A tissue is a group of cells having a common origin and usually performing a common function. A plant is made up of different kinds of tissues. Tissues are classified into two main groups, namely, meristematic and permanent tissues based on whether the cells being formed are capable of dividing or not.</p>

    <p class="subheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override">6.1.1 Meristematic Tissues</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">Growth in plants is largely restricted to specialised regions of active cell division called</span> <span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">meristems</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">Gk. meristos</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">: divided). Plants have different kinds of meristems. The meristems which occur at the tips of roots and shoots and produce primary tissues are called</span> <span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">apical meristems</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(Figure 6.1).<br class="calibre3" />
    Roo</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">t apical meristem occupies the tip of a root while the sh</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">oot apical meristem occupies the distant most region of the stem axis. During the formation of leaves and elongation of stem, some cells ‘left behind’ from shoot apical meristem, constitute the</span> <span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">axillary bud</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. Such buds are present in the axils of leaves and are capable of forming a branch or a flower. The meristem which occurs between mature tissues is known as</span> <span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">intercalary meristem</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. They occur in grasses and regenerate parts removed by the grazing herbivores. Both apical meristems and intercalary meristems are</span> <span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">primary meristems</span> <span class="calibre7">because they appear early in life of a plant and contribute to the formation of the primary plant body.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The meristem that occurs in the mature regions of roots and shoots of many plants, particularly those that produce woody axis and appear later than primary meristem is called the</span> <span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">secondary</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">or</span> <span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">lateral meristem.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">They are cylindrical meristems. Fascicular vascular cambium, interfascicular cambium and cork-cambium are examples of lateral meristems. These are responsible for producing the secondary tissues.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">Following divisions of cells in both primary and as well as secondary meristems, the newly formed cells become structurally and functionally specialised and lose the ability to divide.

During the formation of the primary plant body, specific regions of the apical meristem produce dermal tissues, ground tissues and vascular tissues.</span></p>

The cells of the parenchyma are generally isodiametric. They may be spherical, oval, round, polygonal or elongated in shape. Their walls are thin and made up of cellulose. They may either be closely packed or have small intercellular spaces. The parenchyma performs various functions like photosynthesis, storage, secretion.</span></p>

Collenchymatous cells may be oval, spherical or polygonal and often contain chloroplasts. These cells assimilate food when they contain chloroplasts. Intercellular spaces are absent. They provide mechanical support to the growing parts of the plant such as young stem and petiole of a leaf.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">We were discussing types of tissues based on the types of cells present. Let us now consider how tissues vary depending on their location in the plant body. Their structure and function would also be dependent on location. On the basis of their structure and location, there are three types of tissue systems. These are the epidermal tissue system, the ground or fundamental tissue system and the vascular or con</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">ducting tissue system.</span></p>

    <p class="subheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override">6.2.1 Epidermal Tissue System</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The epidermal tissue system forms the outer-most covering of the whole plant body and comprises epidermal cells, stomata and the epidermal appendages &ndash; the trichomes and hairs. The</span> <span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">epidermis</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">is the outermost layer of the primary plant body. It is made up of elongated, compactly arranged cells, which form a continuous layer. Epidermis is usually single-layered. Epidermal cells are parenchymatous with a small amount of cytoplasm lining the cell wall and a large vacuole. The outside of the epidermis is often covered with a waxy thick layer called the</span> <span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">cuticle</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">which prevents the loss of water. Cuticle is absent in roots.</span> <span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">Stomata</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">are structures present in the epidermis of leaves. Stomata regulate the process of transpiration and gaseous exchange. Each stoma is composed of two bean-shaped cells known as</span> <span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">guard cells</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">which enclose stomatal pore</span><span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">In grasses, the guard cells are dumb-bell shaped. The outer walls of guard cells (away from the stomatal pore) are thin and the inner walls (towards the stomatal pore) are highly thickened. The guard cells possess chloroplasts and regulate the opening and closing of stomata. Sometimes, a few epidermal cells, in the vicinity of the guard cells become specialised in their shape and size and are known as</span> <span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">subsidiary cells</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">.

      <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">Anatomically, a plant is made of different kinds of tissues. The plant tissues are broadly classified into meristematic (apical, lateral and intercalary) and permanent (simple and complex). Assimilation of food and its storage, transportation of water, minerals and photosynthates, and mechanical support are the main functions of tissues. There are three types of tissue systems &ndash; epidermal, ground and vascular. The epidermal tissue systems are made of epidermal cells, stomata and the epidermal appendages. The ground tissue system forms the main bulk of the plant. It is divided into three zones &ndash; cortex, pericycle and pith. The vascular tissue system is formed by the xylem and phloem. On the basis of presence of cambium, location of xylem and phloem, the vascular bundles are of different types. The vascular bundles form the conducting tissue and translocate water, minerals and food material.</p>

      <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">Monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants show marked variation in their internal structures. They differ in type, number and location of vascular bundles. The secondary growth occurs in most of the dicotyledonous roots and stems and it increases the girth (diameter) of the organs by the activity of the vascular cambium and the cork cambium. The wood is actually a secondary xylem. There are different types of wood on the basis of their composition and time of production.</p>
