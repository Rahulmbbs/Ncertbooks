    <p class="chapter-index"><span class="char-style-override">All animals including human beings depend on plants for their food. Have you ever wondered from where plants get their food? Green plants, in fact, have to make or rather synthesise the food they need and all other organisms depend on them for their needs. Green plants carry out ‘photosynthesis’, a physico-chemical process by which they use light energy to drive the synthesis of organic compounds. Ultimately, all living forms on earth depend on sunlight for energy. The use of energy from sunlight by plants doing photosynthesis is the basis of life on earth. Photosynthesis is important due to two reasons: it is the primary source of all food on earth. It is also responsible for the release of oxygen into the atmosphere by green plants.</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">Have you ever thought what would happen if there were no oxygen to breath?</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">This chapter focusses on the structure of the photosynthetic machinery and the various reactions that transform light energy into chemical energy.</span></p>

    <p class="conceptheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">13.1 What do we Know?</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Let us try to find out what we already know about photosynthesis. Some simple experiments you may have done in the earlier classes have shown that chlorophyll (green pigment of the leaf), light and CO</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">are required for photosynthesis to occur.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">You may have carried out the experiment to look for starch formation in two leaves &ndash; a variegated leaf or a leaf that was partially covered with black paper, and one that was exposed to light.

    <p class="chapter-index"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Another experiment you may have carried out is the half-leaf experiment, where a part of a leaf is enclosed in a test tube containing some KOH soaked cotton (which absorbs CO</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">), while the other half is exposed to air. The setup is then placed in light for some time. On testing for starch later in the two halves of the leaf, you must have found that the exposed part of the leaf tested positive for starch while the portion that was in the tube, tested negative. This showed that CO</span><sub class="calibre6"><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">2</span></sub> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">was required for photosynthesis.</span> <span class="char-style-override">Can you explain how this conclusion could be drawn?</span></p>

    <p class="conceptheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">13.2 Early Experiments</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">It is interesting to learn about those simple experiments that led to a gradual development in our understanding of photosynthesis.</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) in 1770 performed a series of experiments that revealed the essential role of air in the growth of green plants. Priestley, you may recall, discovered oxygen in 1774. Priestley observed that a candle burning in a closed space &ndash; a bell jar, soon gets extinguished (Figure 13.1 a, b, c, d). Similarly, a mouse would soon suffocate in a closed space. He concluded that a burning candle or an animal that breathe the air, both somehow, damage the air. But when he placed a mint plant in the same bell jar, he found that the mouse stayed alive and the candle continued to burn. Priestley hypothesised as follows: Plants restore to the air whatever breathing animals and burning candles remove.</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Can you imagine how Priestley would have conducted the experiment using a candle and a plant? Remember, he would need to rekindle the candle to test whether it burns after a few days.</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">How many different ways can you think of to light the candle without disturbing the set-up?</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Using a similar setup as the one used by Priestley, but by placing it once in the dark and once in the sunlight, Jan Ingenhousz (1730-1799) showed that sunlight is essential to the plant process that somehow purifies the air fouled by burning candles or breathing animals. Ingenhousz in an elegant experiment with an aquatic plant showed that in bright sunlight, small bubbles were formed around the green parts while in the dark they did not. Later he identified these bubbles to be of oxygen. Hence he showed that it is only the green part of the plants that could release oxygen.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">It was not until about 1854 that Julius von Sachs provided evidence for production of glucose when plants grow. Glucose is usually stored as starch. His later studies showed that the green substance in plants (chlorophyll as we know it now) is located in special bodies (later called chloroplasts) within plant cells. He found that the green parts in plants is where glucose is made, and that the glucose is usually stored as starch.</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Now consider the interesting experiments done by T.W Engelmann (1843 &ndash; 1909). Using a prism he split light into its spectral components and then illuminated a green alga,</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">Cladophora</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">, placed in a suspension of aerobic bacteria. The bacteria were used to detect the sites of O</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">evolution. He observed that the bacteria accumulated mainly in the region of blue and red light of the split spectrum. A first action spectrum of photosynthesis was thus described. It resembles roughly the absorption spectra of chlorophyll</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">a</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">and</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">b</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">(discussed in section 13.4).</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">By the middle of the nineteenth century the key features of plant photosynthesis were known, namely, that plants could use light energy to make carbohydrates from CO</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">and water. The empirical equation representing the total process of photosynthesis for oxygen evolving organisms was then understood as:</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><img alt="16" src="images/000017.png" class="calibre7" />&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">where [CH</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">O] represented a carbohydrate (e.g., glucose, a six-carbon sugar).</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">A milestone contribution to the understanding of photosynthesis was that made by a microbiologist, Cornelius van Niel</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">(1897-1985), who, based on his studies of purple and green bacteria, demonstrated that photosynthesis is essentially a light-dependent reaction in which hydrogen from a suitable oxidisable compound reduces carbon dioxide to carbohydrates. This can be expressed by:</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">&nbsp;<img alt="17" src="images/000007.png" class="calibre7" /></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">In green plants H</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">O is the hydrogen donor and is oxidised to O</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">. Some organisms do not release O</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">during photosynthesis. When H</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">2</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">S, instead is the hydrogen donor for purple and green sulphur bacteria, the ‘oxidation’ product is sulphur or sulphate depending on the organism and not O</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">. Hence, he inferred that the O</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">evolved by the green plant comes from H</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">O, not from carbon dioxide. This was later proved by using radioisotopic techniques. The correct equation, that would represent the overall process of photosynthesis is therefore:</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">&nbsp;<img alt="18" src="images/000012.png" class="calibre7" /></p>

The O</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">released is from water; this was proved using radio isotope techniques. Note that this is not a single reaction but description of a multistep process called photosynthesis.</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">Can you explain why twelve molecules of water as substrate are used in the equation given above?</span></p>

    <p class="conceptheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">13.3 Where does Photosynthesis take Place?</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">You would of course answer: in ‘the green leaf’ or you may add, ‘in the chloroplasts’ based on what you earlier read in Chapter 8. You are definitely right. Photosynthesis does take place in the green leaves of plants but it does so also in other green parts of the plants.</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">Can you name some other parts where you think photosynthesis may occur?</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">You would recollect from previous unit that the mesophyll cells in the leaves, have a large number of chloroplasts. Usually the chloroplasts align themselves along the walls of the mesophyll cells, such that they get the optimum quantity of the incident light.</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">When do you think the chloroplasts will be aligned with their flat surfaces parallel to the walls? When would they be perpendicular to the incident light?</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">You have studied the structure of chloroplast in Chapter 8. Within the chloroplast there is the membranous system consisting of grana, the stroma lamellae, and the fluid stroma (Figure 13.2). There is a clear division of labour within the chloroplast. The membrane system is responsible for trapping the light energy and also for the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. In stroma, enzymatic reactions incorporate CO</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">into the plant leading to the synthesis of sugar, which in turn forms starch. The former set of reactions, since they are directly light driven are called</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">light reactions.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">The latter are not directly light driven but are dependent on the products of light reactions (ATP and NADPH). Hence, to distinguish the latter they are called, by convention, as</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">dark reactions</span><span class="char-style-override">. However, this should not be construed to mean that they occur in darkness or that they are not light-dependent.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index"><span class="char-style-override"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Looking at plants have you ever wondered why and how there are so many shades of green in their leaves &ndash; even in the same plant? We can look for an answer to this question by trying to separate the leaf pigments of any green plant through paper chromatography.

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Pigments are substances that have an ability to absorb light, at specific wavelengths.</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">Can you guess which is the most abundant plant pigment in the world?</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Let us study the graph showing the ability of chlorophyll</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">a</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">pigment to absorb lights of different wavelengths (Figure 13.3 a). Of course, you are familiar with the wavelength of the visible spectrum of light as well as the VIBGYOR.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">From Figure 13.3a can you determine the wavelength (colour of light) at which chlorophyll a shows the maximum absorption? Does it show another absorption peak at any other wavelengths too? If yes, which one?</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Now look at Figure 13.3b showing the wavelengths at which maximum photosynthesis occurs in a plant.

Hence, we can conclude that chlorophyll</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">a</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">is the chief pigment associated with photosynthesis.</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">But by looking at Figure 13.3c can you say that there is a complete one-to-one overlap between the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll a and the action spectrum of photosynthesis?</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">These graphs, together, show that most of the photosynthesis takes place in the blue and red regions of the spectrum; some photosynthesis does take place at the other wavelengths of the visible spectrum.

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Living organisms have the capability of extracting energy from oxidisable substances and store this in the form of bond energy. Special substances like ATP, carry this energy in their chemical bonds. The process through</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">which ATP is synthesised by cells (in mitochondria and chloroplasts) is named phosphorylation. Photo-phosphorylation is the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate in the presence of light. When the two photosystems work in a series, first PS II and then the PS I, a process called non-cyclic photo-phosphorylation occurs. The two photosystems are connected through an electron transport chain, as seen earlier &ndash; in the Z scheme. Both ATP and NADPH + H</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre9">+</sup></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">are synthesised by this kind of electron flow (Figure 13.5).</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">When only PS I is functional, the electron is circulated within the photosystem and the phosphorylation occurs due to cyclic flow of electrons (Figure 13.6).

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Let us now try and understand how actually ATP is synthesised in the chloroplast. The chemiosmotic hypothesis has been put forward to explain the mechanism. Like in respiration, in photosynthesis too, ATP synthesis is linked to development of a proton gradient across a membrane. This time these are membranes of the thylakoid. There is one difference though, here the proton accumulation is towards the inside of the membrane, i.e., in the lumen. In respiration, protons accumulate in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria when electrons move through the ETS (Chapter 14).</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Let us understand what causes the proton gradient across the membrane. We need to consider again the processes that take place during the activation of electrons and their transport to determine the steps that cause a proton gradient to develop (Figure 13.7).</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">(a) Since splitting of the water molecule takes place on the inner side of the membrane, the protons or hydrogen ions that are produced by the splitting of water accumulate within the lumen of the thylakoids.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">(b) As electrons move through the photosystems, protons are transported across the membrane. This happens because the primary accepter of electron which is located towards the outer side of the membrane transfers its electron not to an electron carrier but to an H carrier. Hence, this molecule removes a proton from the stroma while transporting an electron. When this molecule passes on its electron to the electron carrier on the inner side of the membrane, the proton is released into the inner side or the lumen side of the membrane.</p>

    <p class="chapter-index"><span class="char-style-override">(c) The NADP reductase enzyme is located on the stroma side of the&nbsp;</span>membrane. Along with electrons that come from the acceptor of electrons of PS I, protons are necessary for the reduction of NADP<span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">+</span>&nbsp;<span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">to NADPH+ H</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">+</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">.

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">Hence, within the chloroplast, protons in the stroma decrease in number, while in the lumen there is accumulation of protons. This creates a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane as well as a measurable decrease in pH in the lumen.</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Why are we so interested in the proton gradient? This gradient is important because it is the breakdown of this gradient that leads to release of energy. The gradient is broken down due to the movement of protons across the membrane to the stroma through the transmembrane channel of the F</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">0</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">of the ATPase. The ATPase enzyme consists of two parts: one called the F</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">0</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">is embedded in the membrane and forms a transmembrane channel that carries out facilitated diffusion of protons across the membrane. The other portion is called F</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">1</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">and protrudes on the outer surface of the thylakoid membrane on the side that faces the stroma. The break down of the gradient provides enough energy to cause a conformational change in the F</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">1</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">particle of the ATPase, which makes the enzyme synthesise several molecules of energy-packed ATP.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">Chemiosmosis requires a membrane, a proton pump, a proton gradient and ATPase. Energy is used to pump protons across a membrane, to create a gradient or a high concentration of protons within the thylakoid lumen. ATPase has a channel that allows diffusion of protons back across the membrane; this releases enough energy to activate ATPase enzyme that catalyses the formation of ATP.</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Along with the NADPH produced by the movement of electrons, the ATP will be used immediately in the biosynthetic reaction taking place in the stroma, responsible for fixing CO</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">, and synthesis of sugars.</span></p>

    <p class="conceptheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">13.7 Where are the ATP and NADPH Used?</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">We learnt that the products of light reaction are ATP, NADPH and O</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">. Of these O</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">diffuses out of the chloroplast while ATP and NADPH are used to drive the processes leading to the synthesis of food, more accurately, sugars. This is the</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">biosynthetic phase</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">of photosynthesis. This process does not directly depend on the presence of light but is dependent on the products of the light reaction, i.e., ATP and NADPH, besides CO</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">and H</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">O. You may wonder how this could be verified; it is simple: immediately after light becomes unavailable, the biosynthetic process continues for some time, and then stops. If then, light is made available, the synthesis starts again.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">Can we, hence, say that calling the biosynthetic phase as the</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">dark reaction</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">is a misnomer? Discuss this amongst yourselves.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Let us now see how the ATP and NADPH are used in the biosynthetic phase. We saw earlier that CO</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">is combined with H</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">O to produce (CH</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">O)</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">n</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">or sugars.

Just after world war II, among the several efforts to put radioisotopes to beneficial use, the work of Melvin Calvin is exemplary. The use of radioactive</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">14</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">C by him in algal photosynthesis studies led to the discovery that the first CO</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">fixation product was a&nbsp;3-carbon organic acid. He also contributed to working out the complete biosynthetic pathway; hence it was called</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">Calvin cycle</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">after him. The first product identified was</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">3-phosphoglyceric</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">acid or in short</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">PGA</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">.</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">How</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">many carbon atoms does it have?</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">Scientists also tried to know whether all plants have PGA as the first product of CO</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">fixation, or whether any other product was formed in other plants.

    <p class="chapter-index"></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">An understanding of the factors that affect photosynthesis is necessary. The rate of photosynthesis is very important in determining the yield of plants including crop plants. Photosynthesis is under the influence of several factors, both internal (plant) and external. The plant factors include the number, size, age and orientation of leaves, mesophyll cells and chloroplasts, internal CO</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">concentration and the amount of chlorophyll. The plant or internal factors are dependent on the genetic predisposition and the growth of the plant.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">The external factors would include the availability of sunlight, temperature, CO</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">concentration and water. As a plant photosynthesises, all these factors will simultaneously affect its rate. Hence, though several factors interact and simultaneously affect photosynthesis or CO</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">fixation, usually one factor is the major cause or is the one that limits the rate. Hence, at any point the rate will be determined by the factor available at sub-optimal levels.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">When several factors affect any [bio] chemical process, Blackman’s (1905)</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">Law of Limiting Factors</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">comes into effect. This states the following:</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">If a chemical process is affected by more than one factor, then its rate will be determined by the factor which is nearest to its minimal value: it is the factor which directly affects the process if its quantity is changed.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">For example, despite the presence of a green leaf and optimal light and CO</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre6">2</sub></span> <span class="char-style-override">conditions, the plant may not photosynthesise if the temperature is very low.

At higher light intensities, gradually the rate does not show further increase as other factors become limiting (Figure 13.10).

      <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">Green plants make their own food by photosynthesis. During this process carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is taken in by leaves through stomata and used for making carbohydrates, principally glucose and starch. Photosynthesis takes place only in the green parts of the plants, mainly the leaves. Within the leaves, the mesophyll cells have a large number of chloroplasts that are responsible for CO</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre16">2</sub></span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">fixation. Within the chloroplasts, the membranes are sites for the light reaction, while the chemosynthetic pathway occurs in the stroma. Photosynthesis has two stages: the light reaction and the carbon fixing reactions. In the light reaction the light energy is absorbed by the pigments present in the antenna, and funnelled to special chlorophyll</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">a</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">molecules called reaction centre chlorophylls. There are two photosystems, PS I and PS II. PS I has a 700 nm absorbing chlorophyll</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">a</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">P700 molecule at its reaction centre, while PS II has a P680 reaction centre that absorbs red light at 680 nm. After absorbing light, electrons are excited and transferred through PS II and PS I and finally to NAD forming NADH. During this process a proton gradient is created across the membrane of the thylakoid. The breakdown of the protons gradient due to movement through the F</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">0</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">part of the ATPase enzyme releases enough energy for synthesis of ATP. Splitting of water molecules is associated with PS II resulting in the release of O</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre16">2</sub></span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">, protons and transfer of electrons to PS II.</span></p>

      <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">In the carbon fixation cycle, CO</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre16">2</sub></span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">is added by the enzyme,</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override">RuBisCO</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">, to a 5-carbon compound RuBP that is converted to 2 molecules of 3-carbon PGA. This is then converted to sugar by the Calvin cycle, and the RuBP is regenerated. During this process ATP and NADPH synthesised in the light reaction are utilised.</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">RuBisCO</span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">also catalyses a wasteful oxygenation reaction in C</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre16">3</sub></span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">plants: photorespiration.</span></p>

      <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">Some tropical plants show a special type of photosynthesis called C</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre16">4</sub></span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">pathway. In these plants the first product of CO</span><span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre16">2</sub></span> <span class="char-style-override" lang="en-GB">fixation that takes place in the mesophyll, is a 4-carbon compound.
