      <p class="text"><span class="calibre7">As you know, the functions of the organs/organ systems in our body must be coordinated to maintain homeostasis.</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">Coordination</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">is the process through which two or more organs interact and complement the functions of one another. For example, when we do physical exercises, the energy demand is increased for maintaining an increased muscular activity. The supply of oxygen is also increased. The increased supply of oxygen necessitates an increase in the rate of respiration, heart beat and increased blood flow via blood vessels. When physical exercise is stopped, the activities of nerves, lungs, heart and kidney gradually return to their normal conditions. Thus, the functions of muscles, lungs, heart, blood vessels, kidney and other organs are coordinated while performing physical exercises. In our body the neural system and the endocrine system jointly coordinate and integrate all the activities of the organs so that they function in a synchronised fashion.</span></p>

      <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The neural system provides an organised network of point-to-point connections for a quick coordination. The endocrine system provides chemical integration through hormones. In this chapter, you will learn about the neural system of human, mechanisms of neural coordination like transmission of nerve impulse, impulse conduction across a synapse and the physiology of reflex action.</span></p>

      <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The neural system of all animals is composed of highly specialised cells called</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">neurons</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">which can detect, receive and transmit different kinds of stimuli.</span></p>

      <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The neural organisation is very simple in lower invertebrates. For example, in</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">Hydra</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">it is composed of a network of neurons. The neural system is better organised in insects, where a brain is present along with a number of ganglia and neural tissues. The vertebrates have a more developed neural system.</span></p>

      <p class="text" lang="en-US">The human neural system is divided into two parts :</p>

The PNS comprises of all the nerves of the body associated with the CNS (brain and spinal cord). The nerve fibres of the PNS are of two types :</span></p>

      <p class="text" lang="en-US">The afferent nerve fibres transmit impulses from tissues/organs to the CNS and the efferent fibres transmit regulatory impulses from the CNS to the concerned peripheral tissues/organs.</p>

      <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The PNS is divided into two divisions called</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">somatic neural system</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">and</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">autonomic neural system</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. The somatic neural system relays impulses from the CNS to skeletal muscles while the autonomic neural system transmits impulses from the CNS to the involuntary organs and smooth muscles of the body. The autonomic neural system is further classified into</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">sympathetic neural system</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">and</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">parasympathetic neural system</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">.</span></p>

      <p class="text"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">A neuron is a microscopic structure composed of three major parts, namely,</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">cell body</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">,</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">dendrites</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">and</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">axon</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(Figure 21.1). The cell body contains cytoplasm with typical cell organelles and certain granular bodies called</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">Nissl’s granules</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. Short fibres which branch repeatedly and project out of the cell body also contain Nissl’s granules and are called dendrites. These fibres transmit impulses towards the cell body. The axon is a long fibre, the distal end of which is branched. Each branch terminates as a bulb-like structure called</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">synaptic knob</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">which possess synaptic vesicles containing chemicals called</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">neurotransmitters</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. The axons transmit nerve impulses away from the cell body to a synapse or to a neuro-muscular junction. Based on the number of axon and dendrites, the neurons are divided into three types, i.e.,</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">multipolar</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(with one axon and two or more dendrites; found in the cerebral cortex),</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">bipolar</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(with one axon and one dendrite, found in the retina of eye) and</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">unipolar</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(cell body with one axon only; found usually in the embryonic stage). There are two types of axons, namely,</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">myelinated</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">and</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">non-myelinated</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. The myelinated nerve fibres are enveloped with</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">Schwann cells,</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">which form a myelin sheath around the axon. The gaps between two adjacent myelin sheaths are called</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">nodes of Ranvier</span><span class="calibre7">. Myelinated nerve fibres are found in spinal and cranial nerves. Unmyelinated nerve fibre is enclosed by a Schwann cell that does not form a myelin sheath around the axon, and is commonly found in autonomous and the somatic neural systems.</span></p>

      <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">Neurons are excitable cells because their membranes are in a polarised state.</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">Do you know why the membrane of a neuron is polarised?</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">Different types of ion channels are present on the neural membrane. These ion channels are selectively permeable to different ions. When a neuron is not conducting any impulse, i.e., resting, the axonal membrane is comparatively more permeable to potassium ions (K</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre8">+</sup></span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">) and nearly impermeable to sodium ions (Na</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre8">+</sup></span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">). Similarly, the membrane is impermeable to negatively charged proteins present in the axoplasm. Consequently, the axoplasm inside the axon contains high concentration of</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">K</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre8">+</sup></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">and negatively charged proteins and low concentration of Na</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre8">+</sup></span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. In contrast, the fluid outside the axon contains a low concentration of</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">K</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre8">+</sup></span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">, a high concentration of Na</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">+</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">and thus form a concentration gradient. These ionic gradients across the resting membrane are maintained by the active transport of ions by the sodium-potassium pump which transports 3N</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">a</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre8">+</sup></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">outwards for 2</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">K</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre8">+</sup></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">into the cell. As a result, the outer surface of the axonal membrane possesses a positive charge while its inner surface becomes negatively charged and therefore is polarised. The electrical potential difference across the resting plasma membrane is called as the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">resting potential</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">.</span></p>

      <p class="text"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">You might be curious to know about the mechanisms of generation of nerve impulse and its conduction along an axon. When a stimulus is applied at a site (Figure 21.2 e.g., point A) on the polarised membrane, the membrane at the site A becomes freely permeable to Na</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre8">+</sup></span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. This leads to a rapid influx of Na</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre8">+</sup></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">followed by the reversal of the polarity at that site, i.e., the outer surface of the membrane becomes negatively charged and the inner side becomes positively charged. The polarity of the membrane at the site A is thus reversed and hence depolarised. The electrical potential difference across the plasma membrane at the site A is called the</span>&nbsp;<span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">action potential</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">, which is in fact termed as a</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">nerve impulse</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. At sites immediately ahead, the axon (e.g., site B) membrane has a positive charge on the outer surface and a negative charge on its inner surface. As a result, a current flows on the inner surface from site A to site B. On the outer surface current flows from site B to site A (Figure 21.2) to complete the circuit of current flow. Hence, the polarity at the site is reversed, and an action potential is generated at site B. Thus, the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">impulse</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(action potential) generated at site A arrives at site B. The sequence is repeated along the length of the axon and consequently the impulse is conducted. The rise in the stimulus-induced permeability to Na</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre8">+</sup></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">is extremely short-lived. It is quickly followed by a rise in permeability to K</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre8">+</sup></span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. Within a fraction of a second, K</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre8">+</sup></span> <span class="calibre7">diffuses outside the membrane and restores the resting potential of the membrane at the site of excitation and the fibre becomes once more responsive to further stimulation.</span></p>

      <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">A nerve impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another through junctions called synapses. A</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">synapse</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">is formed by the membranes of a pre-synaptic neuron and a post-synaptic neuron, which may or may not be separated by a gap called</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">synaptic cleft</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. There are two types of synapses, namely, electrical synapses and chemical synapses. At electrical synapses, the membranes of pre- and post-synaptic neurons are in very close proximity. Electrical current can flow directly from one neuron into the other across these synapses. Transmission of an impulse across electrical synapses is very similar to impulse conduction along a single axon. Impulse transmission across an electrical synapse is always faster than that across a chemical synapse. Electrical synapses are rare in our system.</span></p>

      <p class="text"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">At a chemical synapse, the membranes of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons are separated by a fluid-filled space called synaptic cleft&nbsp;(Figure 21.3).</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">Do you know how the pre-synaptic neuron transmits an impulse (action potential) across the synaptic cleft to the post-synaptic neuron</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">? Chemicals called neurotransmitters are involved in the transmission of impulses at these synapses. The axon terminals contain vesicles filled with these neurotransmitters. When an impulse (action potential) arrives at the axon terminal, it stimulates the movement of the synaptic vesicles towards the membrane where they fuse with the plasma membrane and release their neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. The released neurotransmitters bind to their specific</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">receptors</span><span class="calibre7">, present on the post-synaptic membrane. This binding opens ion channels allowing the entry of ions which can generate a new potential in the post-synaptic neuron. The new potential developed may be either excitatory or inhibitory.</span></p>

      <p class="text" lang="en-US">The brain is the central information processing organ of our body, and acts as the ‘command and control system’. It controls the voluntary movements, balance of the body, functioning of vital involuntary organs (e.g., lungs, heart, kidneys, etc.), thermoregulation, hunger and thirst, circadian (24-hour) rhythms of our body, activities of several endocrine glands and human behaviour. It is also the site for processing of vision, hearing, speech, memory, intelligence, emotions and thoughts.</p>

      <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The human brain is well protected by the skull.

Cerebrum forms the major part of the human brain. A deep cleft divides the cerebrum longitudinally into two halves, which are termed as the left and right</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">cerebral hemispheres</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. The hemispheres are connected by a tract of nerve fibres called</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">corpus callosum</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. The layer of cells which covers the cerebral hemisphere is called cerebral cortex and is thrown into prominent folds. The cerebral cortex is referred to as the grey matter due to its greyish appearance. The neuron cell bodies are concentrated here giving the colour. The cerebral cortex contains motor areas, sensory areas and large regions that are neither clearly sensory nor motor in function. These regions called as the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">association areas</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">are responsible for complex functions like intersensory associations, memory and communication. Fibres of the tracts are covered with the myelin sheath, which constitute the inner part of cerebral hemisphere. They give an opaque white appearance to the layer and, hence, is called the white matter. The cerebrum wraps around a structure called thalamus, which is a major coordinating centre for sensory and motor signaling. Another very important part of the brain called</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">hypothalamus</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">lies at the base of the thalamus. The hypothalamus contains a number of centres which control body temperature, urge for eating and drinking. It also contains several groups of neurosecretory cells, which secrete hormones called hypothalamic hormones. The inner parts of cerebral hemispheres and a group of associated deep structures like amygdala, hippocampus, etc., form a complex structure called the limbic lobe or limbic system. Along with the hypothalamus, it is involved in the regulation of sexual behaviour, expression of emotional reactions (e.g., excitement, pleasure, rage and fear), and motivation.</span></p>

      <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">You must have experienced a sudden withdrawal of a body part which comes in contact with objects that are extremely hot, cold pointed or animals that are scary or poisonous. The entire process of response to a peripheral nervous stimulation, that occurs involuntarily, i.e., without conscious effort or thought and requires the involvment of a part of the central nervous system is called a</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">reflex action</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. The reflex pathway comprises at least one afferent neuron (receptor) and one efferent (effector or excitor) neuron appropriately arranged in a series (Figure 21.5). The afferent neuron receives signal from a sensory organ and transmits the impulse via a dorsal nerve root into the CNS (at the level of spinal cord). The efferent nueuron then carries signals from CNS to the effector. The stimulus and response thus forms a reflex arc as shown below in the knee jerk reflex. You should carefully study Figure 21.5 to understand the mechanism of a knee jerk reflex.</span></p>

How do you hear a sound?</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The sensory organs detect all types of changes in the environment and send appropriate signals to the CNS, where all the inputs are processed and analysed. Signals are then sent to different parts/centres of the brain. This is how you can sense changes in the environment. In the following sections, you will be introduced to the structure and functioning of the eye (sensory organ for vision) and the ear (sensory organ for hearing).</span></p>

      <p class="text"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The adult human eye ball is nearly a spherical structure. The wall of the eye ball is composed of three layers (Figure 21.6). The external layer is composed of a dense connective tissue and is called the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">sclera</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. The anterior portion of this layer is called the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">cornea</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. The middle layer,</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">choroid</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">, contains many blood vessels and looks bluish in colour. The choroid layer is thin over the posterior two-thirds of the eye ball, but it becomes thick in the anterior part to form the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">ciliary body</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. The ciliary body itself continues forward to form a pigmented and opaque structure called the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">iris</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">which is the visible coloured portion of the eye. The eye ball contains a transparent crystalline</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">lens</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">which is held in place by ligaments attached to the ciliary body. In front of the lens, the aperture surrounded by the iris is called the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">pupil</span><span class="calibre7">. The diameter of the pupil is regulated by the muscle fibres of iris.</span></p>

      <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The inner layer is the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">retina</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">and it contains three layers of neural cells &ndash; from inside to outside &ndash; ganglion cells, bipolar cells and photoreceptor cells. There are two types of photoreceptor cells, namely,</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">rods</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">and</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">cones</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. These cells contain the light-sensitive proteins called the photopigments. The daylight (photopic) vision and colour vision are functions of cones and the twilight (scotopic) vision is the function of the rods. The rods contain a purplish-red protein called the rhodopsin or visual purple, which contains a derivative of Vitamin A. In the human eye, there are three types of cones which possess their own characteristic photopigments that respond to red, green and blue lights. The sensations of different colours are produced by various combinations of these cones and their photopigments. When these cones are stimulated equally, a sensation of white light is produced.</span></p>

Photoreceptor cells are not present in that region and hence it is called the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">blind spot</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. At the posterior pole of the eye lateral to the blind spot, there is a yellowish pigmented spot called macula lutea with a central pit called the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">fovea</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">. The fovea is a thinned-out portion of the retina where only the cones are densely packed. It is the point where the visual acuity (resolution) is the greatest.</span></p>

      <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The space between the cornea and the lens is called the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">aqueous chamber</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">and contains a thin watery fluid called aqueous humor.

      <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The light rays in visible wavelength focussed on the retina through the cornea and lens generate potentials (impulses) in rods and cones. As mentioned earlier, the photosensitive compounds (photopigments) in the human eyes is composed of</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">opsin</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(a protein) and</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">retinal</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(an aldehyde of vitamin A). Light induces dissociation of the retinal from opsin resulting in changes in the structure of the opsin. This causes membrane permeability changes. As a result, potential differences are generated in the photoreceptor cells. This produces a signal that generates action potentials in the ganglion cells through the bipolar cells. These action potentials (impulses) are transmitted by the optic nerves to the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">visual cortex</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">area of the brain, where the neural impulses are analysed and the image formed on the retina is recognised based on earlier memory and experience.</span></p>

      <p class="text"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">The ears perform two sensory functions, hearing and maintenance of body balance. Anatomically, the ear can be divided into three major sections called the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">outer ear</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">, the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">middle ear</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">and the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">inner ear</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(Figure 21.7). The</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">outer ear consists of the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">pinna</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">and</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">external auditory meatus</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(canal). The pinna collects the vibrations in the air which produce sound. The external auditory meatus leads inwards and extends up to the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">tympanic membrane</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">(the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">ear drum</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">). There are very fine hairs and wax-secreting glands in the skin of the pinna and the meatus. The tympanic membrane is composed of connective tissues covered with skin outside and with mucus membrane inside. The middle ear contains three ossicles called</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">malleus</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">,</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">incus</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">and</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">stapes</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">which are attached to one another in a chain-like fashion. The malleus is attached to the tympanic membrane and the stapes is attached to the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">oval window</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre7">of the cochlea. The ear ossicles increase the efficiency of transmission of sound waves to the inner ear. An</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">Eustachian tube</span> <span class="calibre7">connects the middle ear cavity with the pharynx. The Eustachian tube helps in equalising the pressures on either sides of the ear drum.</span></p>

The external ear receives sound waves and directs them to the ear drum. The ear drum vibrates in response to the sound waves and these vibrations are transmitted through the ear ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) to the oval window. The vibrations are passed through the oval window on to the fluid of the cochlea, where they generate waves in the lymphs. The waves in the lymphs induce a ripple in the basilar membrane. These movements of the basilar membrane bend the hair cells, pressing them against the tectorial membrane. As a result, nerve impulses are generated in the associated afferent neurons. These impulses are transmitted by the afferent fibres via auditory nerves to the auditory cortex of the brain, where the impulses are analysed and the sound is recognised.</span></p>

        <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">The neural system coordinates and integrates functions as well as metabolic and homeostatic activities of all the organs. Neurons, the functional units of neural system are excitable cells due to a differential concentration gradient of ions across the membrane. The electrical potential difference across the resting neural membrane is called the ‘resting potential’. The nerve impulse is conducted along the axon membrane in the form of a wave of depolarisation and repolarisation. A synapse is formed by the membranes of a pre-synaptic neuron and a post-synaptic neuron which may or may not be separated by a gap called synaptic cleft. Chemicals involved in the transmission of impulses at chemical synapses are called neurotransmitters.</span></p>

        <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">Human neural system consists of two parts</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">: (i) central neural system (CNS) and (ii) the peripheral neural system. The CNS consists of the brain and spiral cord. The brain can be divided into three major parts : (i) forebrain, (ii) midbrain and (iii) hindbrain. The forebrain consists of cerebrum, thalamus and hypothalamus. The cerebrum is longitudinally divided into two halves that are connected by the corpus callosum. A very important part of the forebrain called hypothalamus controls the body temperature, eating and drinking. Inner parts of cerebral hemispheres and a group of associated deep structures form a complex structure called limbic system which is concerned with olfaction, autonomic responses, regulation of sexual behaviour, expression of emotional reactions, and motivation. The midbrain receives and integrates visual, tactile and auditory inputs. The hindbrain comprises pons, cerebellum and medulla. The cerebellum integrates information received from the semicircular canals of the ear and the auditory system. The medulla contains centres, which control respiration, cardiovascular reflexes, and gastric secretions. Pons consist of fibre tracts that interconnect different regions of the brain. The entire process of involuntary response to a peripheral nervous stimulation is called reflex action.</span></p>

        <p class="text" lang="en-US">Information regarding changes in the environment is received by the CNS through the sensory organs which are processed and analysed. Signals are then sent for necessary adjustments. The wall of the human eye ball is composed of three layers. The external layer is composed of cornea and sclera. Inside sclera is the middle layer, which is called the choroid. Retina, the innermost layer, contains two types of photoreceptor cells, namely rods and cones. The daylight (photopic) vision and colour vision are functions of cones and twilight (scotopic) vision is the function of the rods. The light enters through cornea, the lens and the images of objects are formed on the retina.</p>

        <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">The ear can be divided into the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear. The middle ear contains three ossicles called malleus, incus and stapes. The fluid filled inner ear is called the labyrinth, and the coiled portion of the labyrinth is called cochlea. The organ of corti is a structure which contains hair cells that act as auditory receptors and is located on the basilar membrane. The vibrations produced in the ear drum are transmitted through the ear ossicles and oval window to the fluid-filled inner ear. Nerve impulses are generated and transmitted by the afferent fibres to the auditory cortex of the brain. The inner ear also contains a complex system located above the cochlea called vestibular apparatus. It is influenced by gravity and movements, and helps us in maintaining balance of the body and posture.</span></p>
