    <p class="chapter-index">In the previous chapter, we looked at the broad classification of living organisms under the system proposed by Whittaker (1969) wherein he suggested the Five Kingdom classification viz. Monera, Protista, Fungi, Animalia and Plantae. In this chapter, we will deal in detail with further classification within Kingdom Plantae popularly known as the ‘plant kingdom’.</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">We must stress here that our understanding of the plant kingdom has changed over time. Fungi, and members of the Monera and Protista having cell walls have now been excluded from Plantae though earlier classifications placed them in the same kingdom. So, the cyanobacteria that are also referred to as blue green algae are not ‘algae’ any more. In this chapter, we will describe Plantae under Algae, Bryophytes, Pteridophytes, Gymnosperms and Angiosperms.</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Let us also look at classification within angiosperms to understand some of the concerns that influenced the classification systems. The earliest systems of classification used only gross superficial morphological characters such as habit, colour, number and shape of leaves, etc. They were based mainly on vegetative characters or on the androecium structure (system given by Linnaeus). Such systems were</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB"><b class="char-style-override3">artificial;</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">they separated the closely related species since they were based on a few characteristics. Also, the artificial systems gave equal weightage to vegetative and sexual characteristics; this is not acceptable since we know that often the vegetative characters are more easily affected by environment. As against this,</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB"><b class="char-style-override3">natural classification systems</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">developed, which were</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">based on natural affinities among the organisms and consider, not only the external features, but also internal features, like ultra-structure, anatomy, embryology and phytochemistry. Such a classification for flowering plants was given by George Bentham and Joseph Dalton Hooker.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">At present</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB"><b class="char-style-override3">phylogenetic classification systems</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">based on evolutionary relationships between the various organisms are acceptable. This assumes that organisms belonging to the same taxa have a common ancestor. We now use information from many other sources too to help resolve difficulties in classification. These become more important when there is no supporting fossil evidence.</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB"><b class="char-style-override3">Numerical Taxonomy</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">which is now easily carried out using computers is</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">based on all observable characteristics. Number and codes are assigned to all the characters and the data are then processed. In this way each character is given equal importance and at the same time hundreds of characters can be considered.</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB"><b class="char-style-override3">Cytotaxonomy</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">that is based on cytological information like chromosome number, structure, behaviour and</span> <b class="char-style-override3"><span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">chemotaxonomy</span></b> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">that uses the chemical constituents of the plant to resolve confusions, are also used by taxonomists these days.</span></p>

    <p class="conceptheading" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7">3.1 Algae</span><br class="calibre8" /></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">Algae are chlorophyll-bearing, simple, thalloid, autotrophic and largely aquatic (both fresh water and marine) organisms. They occur in a variety of other habitats: moist stones, soils and wood. Some of them also occur in association with fungi (lichen) and animals (e.g., on sloth bear).</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">The form and size of algae is highly variable (Figure 3.1). The size ranges from the microscopic unicellular forms like</span> <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">Chlamydomonas,</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">to colonial forms like</span> <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">Volvox</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">and to the filamentous forms like</span> <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">Ulothrix</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">and</span> <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">Spirogyra.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">A few of the marine forms such as kelps, form massive plant bodies.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">The algae reproduce by vegetative, asexual and sexual methods. Vegetative reproduction is by fragmentation. Each fragment develops into a thallus. Asexual reproduction is by the production of different types of spores, the most common being the</span> <b class="char-style-override3"><span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">zoospores</span></b><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. They are flagellated (motile) and on germination gives rise to new plants. Sexual reproduction takes place through fusion of two gametes. These gametes can be flagellated and similar in size (as in</span> <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">Chlamydomonas</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">) or non-flagellated (non-motile) but similar in size (as in</span> <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">Spirogyra</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">). Such reproduction is called</span> <b class="char-style-override3"><span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">isogamous</span></b><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. Fusion of two gametes dissimilar in size, as in some species of</span> <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">Chlamydomonas</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">is termed as</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB"><b class="char-style-override3">anisogamous</b></span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">.

    <p class="chapter-index"><span class="calibre6">Algae are useful to man in a variety of ways. At least a half of the total carbon dioxide fixation on earth is carried out by algae through photosynthesis. Being photosynthetic they increase the level of dissolved oxygen in their immediate environment. They are of paramount importance as primary producers of energy-rich compounds which form the basis of the food cycles of all aquatic animals. Many species of</span> <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">Porphyra, Laminaria</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">and</span> <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">Sargassum</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">are among the 70 species of marine algae used as food.

The plant body may be unicellular, colonial or filamentous.

The pigments are localised in definite chloroplasts. The chloroplasts may be discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon-shaped in different species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies called pyrenoids located in the chloroplasts. Pyrenoids contain protein besides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets. Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made of an inner layer of cellulose and an outer layer of pectose.</span></p>

They produce a multicellular body called a</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">sporophyte</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. The sporophyte is not free-living but attached to the photosynthetic gametophyte and derives nourishment from it. Some cells of the sporophyte undergo reduction division (meiosis) to produce haploid spores. These spores germinate to produce gametophyte.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">The liverworts grow usually in moist, shady habitats such as banks of streams, marshy ground, damp soil, bark of trees and deep in the woods. The plant body of a liverwort is thalloid, e.g.,</span> <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">Marchantia</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. The thallus is dorsiventral and closely appressed to the substrate. The leafy members have tiny leaf-like appendages in two rows on the stem-like structures.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Asexual reproduction in liverworts takes place by fragmentation of thalli, or by the formation of specialised structures called</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">gemmae<br class="calibre3" /></span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">(sing. gemma). Gemmae are green, multicellular, asexual buds, which develop in small receptacles called gemma cups located on the thalli. The gemmae become detached from the parent body and germinate to form new individuals. During sexual reproduction, male and female sex organs are produced either on the same or on different thalli. The sporophyte is differentiated into a foot, seta and capsule. After meiosis, spores are produced within the capsule. These spores germinate to form free-living gametophytes.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">The predominant stage of the life cycle of a moss is the gametophyte which consists of two stages. The first stage is the</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">protonema</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">stage, which develops directly from a spore. It is a creeping, green, branched and frequently filamentous stage. The second stage is the</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">leafy stage</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">, which develops from the secondary protonema as a lateral bud. They consist of upright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged leaves. They are attached to the soil through multicellular and branched rhizoids. This stage bears the sex organs.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Vegetative reproduction in mosses is by fragmentation and budding in the secondary protonema. In sexual reproduction, the sex organs antheridia and archegonia are produced at the apex of the leafy shoots. After fertilisation, the zygote develops into a sporophyte, consisting of a foot, seta and capsule. The sporophyte in mosses is more elaborate than that in liverworts. The capsule contains spores. Spores are formed after meiosis. The mosses have an elaborate mechanism of spore dispersal. Common examples of mosses are</span> <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">Funaria, Polytrichum</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">and</span> <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">Sphagnum</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">(Figure 3.2)</span><span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">You may recall that in bryophytes the dominant phase in the life cycle is the gametophytic plant body. However, in pteridophytes, the main plant body is a sporophyte which is differentiated into true root, stem and leaves (Figure 3.3). These organs possess well-differentiated vascular tissues. The leaves in pteridophyta are small (microphylls) as in</span> <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">Selaginella</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">or large (macrophylls) as in ferns. The sporophytes bear sporangia that are subtended by leaf-like appendages called</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">sporophylls</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. In some cases sporophylls may form distinct compact structures called strobili or cones (</span><span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">Selaginella, Equisetum</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">). The sporangia produce spores by meiosis in spore mother cells. The spores germinate to give rise to inconspicuous, small but multicellular, free-living, mostly photosynthetic thalloid gametophytes called</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">prothallus</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. These gametophytes require cool, damp, shady places to grow. Because of this specific restricted requirement and the need for water for fertilisation, the spread of living pteridophytes is limited and restricted to narrow geographical regions. The gametophytes bear male and female sex organs called antheridia and archegonia,</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">respectively. Water is required for transfer of antherozoids &ndash; the male gametes released from the antheridia, to the mouth of archegonium. Fusion of male gamete with the egg present in the archegonium result in the formation of zygote. Zygote thereafter produces a multicellular well-differentiated sporophyte which is the dominant phase of the pteridophytes. In majority of the pteridophytes all the spores are of similar kinds; such plants are called</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">homosporous</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. Genera like</span> <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">Selaginella</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">and</span> <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">Salvinia</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">which produce two kinds of spores, macro (large) and micro (small) spores, are known as</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">heterosporous</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. The megaspores and microspores germinate and give rise to female and male gametophytes, respectively. The female gametophytes in these plants are retained on the parent sporophytes for variable periods. The development of the zygotes into young embryos take place within the female gametophytes. This event is a precursor to the</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">seed habit</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">considered an important step in evolution.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">The pteridophytes are further classified into four classes: Psilopsida</span> <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">(Psilotum);</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Lycopsida</span> <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">(Selaginella, Lycopodium)</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">, Sphenopsida</span> <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">(Equisetum)</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">and Pteropsida</span> <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">(Dryopteris, Pteris, Adiantum)</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">.</span></p>

The seeds that develop post-fertilisation, are not covered, i.e., are naked. Gymnosperms include medium-sized trees or tall trees and shrubs (Figure 3.4). One of the gymnosperms, the giant redwood tree</span> <span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">Sequoia</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">is one of the tallest tree species.

    <p class="chapter-index"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">The gymnosperms are heterosporous; they produce haploid microspores and megaspores. The two kinds of spores are produced within sporangia that are borne on sporophylls which are arranged spirally along an axis to form lax or compact strobili or</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">cones</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">.

The microspores develop into a male gametophytic generation which is highly reduced and is confined to only a limited number of cells. This reduced gametophyte is called a</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">pollen grain</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. The development of pollen grains take place within the microsporangia.

The ovules are borne on megasporophylls which may be clustered to form the female cones. The megaspore mother cell divides meiotically to form four megaspores. One of the megaspores enclosed within the</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">megasporangium</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">develops into a multicellular female gametophyte that bears two or more</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">archegonia</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">or female sex organs. The multicellular female gametophyte is also retained within megasporangium.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">Unlike bryophytes and pteridophytes, in gymnosperms the male and the female gametophytes do not have an independent free-living existence. They remain within the sporangia retained on the sporophytes. The pollen grain is released from the microsporangium. They are carried in air currents and come in contact with the opening of the ovules borne on megasporophylls. The pollen tube carrying the male gametes grows towards archegonia in the ovules and discharge their contents near the mouth of the archegonia. Following fertilisation, zygote develops into an embryo and the ovules into seeds. These seeds are not covered.</p>

In angiosperms, the seeds are enclosed by fruits. The angiosperms are an exceptionally large group of plants occurring in wide range of habitats.

        In plants, both haploid and diploid cells can divide by mitosis. This ability leads to the formation of different plant bodies - haploid and diploid. The haploid plant body produces gametes by mitosis. This plant body represents a gametophyte. Following fertilisation the zygote also divides by mitosis to produce a diploid sporophytic plant body. Haploid spores are produced by this plant body by meiosis. These in turn, divide by mitosis to form a haploid plant body once again. Thus, during the life cycle of any sexually reproducing plant, there is an alternation of generations between gamete producing haploid gametophyte and spore producing diploid sporophyte.

      <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">Plant kingdom includes algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms. Algae are chlorophyll-bearing simple, thalloid, autotrophic and largely aquatic organisms. Depending on the type of pigment possesed and the type of stored food, algae are classfied into three classes, namely Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae. Algae usually reproduce vegetatively by fragmentation, asexually by formation of different types of spores and sexually by formation of gametes which may show isogamy, anisogamy or oogamy.</p>

      <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">Bryophytes are plants which can live in soil but are dependent on water for sexual reproduction. Their plant body is more differentiated than that of algae. It is thallus-like and prostrate or erect and attached to the substratum by rhizoids. They possess root-like, leaf-like and stem-like structures. The bryophytes are divided into liverworts and mosses. The plant body of liverworts is thalloid and dorsiventral whereas mosses have upright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged leaves. The main plant body of a bryophyte is gamete-producing and is called a gametophyte. It bears the male sex organs called antheridia and female sex organs called archegonia. The male and female gametes produced fuse to form zygote which produces a multicellular body called a sporophyte. It produces haploid spores. The spores germinate to form gametophytes.</p>

      <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">In pteridophytes the main plant is a sporophyte which is differentiated into true root, stem and leaves. These organs possess well-differentiated vascular tissues. The sporophytes bear sporangia which produce spores. The spores germinate to form gametophytes which require cool, damp places to grow. The gametophytes bear male and female sex organs called antheridia and archegonia, respectively. Water is required for transfer of male gametes to archegonium where zygote is formed after fertilisation. The zygote produces a sporophyte.</p>

      <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">The gymnosperms are the plants in which ovules are not enclosed by any ovary wall. After fertilisation the seeds remain exposed and therefore these plants are called naked-seeded plants. The gymnosperms produce microspores and megaspores which are produced in microsporangia and megasporangia borne on the sporophylls. The sporophylls &ndash; microsporophylls and megasporophylls &ndash; are arranged spirally on axis to form male and female cones, respectively. The pollen grain germinates and pollen tube releases the male gamete into the ovule, where it fuses with the egg cell in archegonia. Following fertilisation, the zygote develops into embryo and the ovules into seeds.</p>

      <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">In angiosperms, the male sex organs (stamen) and female sex organs (pistil) are borne in a flower. Each stamen consists of a filament and an anther. The anther produces pollen grains (male gametophyte) after meiosis. The pistil consists of an ovary enclosing one to many ovules. Within the ovule is the female gametophyte or embryo sac which contains the egg cell. The pollen tube enters the embryo-sac where two male gametes are discharged. One male gamete fuses with egg cell (syngamy) and other fuses with diploid secondary nucleus (triple fusion). This phenomenon of two fusions is called double fertilisation and is unique to angiosperms. The angiosperms are divided into two classes &ndash; the dicotyledons and the monocotyledons.</p>

      <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">During the life cycle of any sexually reproducing plant, there is alternation of generations between gamete producing haploid gametophyte and spore producing diploid sporophyte. However, different plant groups as well as individuals may show different patterns of life cycles &ndash; haplontic, diplontic or intermediate.</p>
