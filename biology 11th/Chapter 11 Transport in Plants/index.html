    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="calibre8">The description of structure and variation of living organisms over a period of time, ended up as two, apparently irreconcilable perspectives on biology. The two perspectives essentially rested on two levels of organisation of life forms and phenomena. One described at organismic and above level of organisation while the second described at cellular and molecular level of organisation. The first resulted in ecology and related disciplines. The second resulted in physiology and biochemistry. Description of physiological processes, in flowering plants as an example, is what is given in the chapters in this unit. The processes of mineral nutrition of plants, photosynthesis, transport, respiration and ultimately plant growth and development are described in molecular terms but in the context of cellular activities and even at organism level. Wherever appropriate, the relation of the physiological processes to environment is also discussed.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">Have you ever wondered how water reaches the top of tall trees, or for that matter how and why substances move from one cell to</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">the other, whether all substances move in a similar way, in the same direction and whether metabolic energy is required for moving substances. Plants need to move molecules over very long distances, much more than animals do; they also do not have a circulatory system in place. Water taken up by the roots has to reach all parts of the plant, up to the very tip of the growing stem. The photosynthates or food synthesised by the leaves have also to be moved to all parts including the root tips embedded deep inside the soil. Movement across short distances, say within the cell, across the membranes and from cell to cell within the tissue has also to take place. To understand some of the transport processes that take place in plants, one would have to recollect oneâ€™s basic knowledge about the structure of the cell and the anatomy of the plant body. We also need to revisit our understanding of diffusion, besides gaining some knowledge about chemical potential and ions.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">When we talk of the movement of substances we need first to define what kind of movement we are talking about, and also what substances we are looking at. In a flowering plant the substances that would need to be transported are water, mineral nutrients, organic nutrients and plant growth regulators. Over small distances substances move by diffusion and by cytoplasmic streaming supplemented by active transport. Transport over longer distances proceeds through the vascular system (the xylem and the phloem) and is called</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">translocation.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">An important aspect that needs to be considered is the direction of transport. In rooted plants, transport in xylem (of water and minerals) is essentially unidirectional, from roots to the stems. Organic and mineral nutrients however, undergo multidirectional transport. Organic compounds synthesised in the photosynthetic leaves are exported to all other parts of the plant including storage organs. From the storage organs they are later re-exported. The mineral nutrients are taken up by the roots and transported upwards into the stem, leaves and the growing regions. When any plant part undergoes senescence, nutrients may be withdrawn from such regions and moved to the growing parts. Hormones or plant growth regulators and other chemical stimuli are also transported, though in very small amounts, sometimes in a strictly polarised or unidirectional manner from where they are synthesised to other parts. Hence, in a flowering plant there is a complex traffic of compounds (but probably very orderly) moving in different directions, each organ receiving some substances and giving out some others.</span></p>

      <p class="subheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">11.1.1 Diffusion</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">Movement by</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">diffusion</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">is passive, and may be from one part of the cell to the other, or from cell to cell, or over short distances</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">,</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">say, from the inter-cellular spaces of the leaf to the outside. No energy expenditure takes place. In diffusion</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">,</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">molecules move in a random fashion, the net result being substances moving from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration. Diffusion is a slow process and is not dependent on a â€˜living systemâ€™. Diffusion is obvious in gases and liquids, but diffusion</span> <span class="calibre8" lang="en-GB">in solids</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">rather than</span> <span class="calibre8" lang="en-GB">of solids</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">is more likely. Diffusion is very important to plants since it</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">is</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">the only means for gaseous movement within the plant body.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">Diffusion rates are affected by the gradient of concentration, the permeability of the membrane separat</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">ing them, temperature and pressure.</span></p>

      <p class="subheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">11.1.2 Facilitated Diffusion</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">As pointed out earlier, a gradient must already be present for diffusion to occur. The diffusion rate depends on the size of the substances; obviously smaller substances diffuse faster. The diffusion of any substance across a membrane also depends on its solubility in lipids, the major constituent of the membrane. Substances soluble in lipids diffuse through the membrane faster. Substances that have a hydrophilic moiety, find it difficult to pass through the membrane; their movement has to be facilitated. Membrane proteins provide sites at which such molecules cross the membrane. They do not set up a concentration gradient: a concentration gradient must already be present for molecules to diffuse even if facilitated by the proteins. This process is called</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">facilitated diffusion</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">In facilitated diffusion special proteins help move substances across membranes without expenditure of ATP energy. Facilitated diffusion cannot cause net transport of molecules from a low to a high concentration &ndash; this would require input of energy. Transport rate reaches a maximum when all of the protein transporters are being used (saturation). Facili</span><span class="calibre8">tated diffusion is very specific: it allows cell to select substances for uptake. It is sensitive to inhibitors which react with protein side chains.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style"></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">The proteins form channels in the membrane for molecules to pass through. Some channels are always open; others can be controlled. Some are large, allowing a variety of molecules to cross. The</span>&nbsp;<span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">porins</span>&nbsp;<span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">are proteins that form huge pores in the outer membranes of the plastids, mitochondria and some bacteria allowing molecules up to the size of small proteins to pass through.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">Active transport uses energy to pump molecules against a concentration gradient. Active transport is carried out by membrane-proteins. Hence different proteins in the membrane play a major role in both active as well as passive transport. Pumps are proteins that use energy to carry substances across the cell membrane. These pumps can transport substances from a low concentration to a high concentration (â€˜uphillâ€™ transport). Transport rate reaches a maximum when all the protein transporters are being used or are saturated. Like enzymes the carrier protein is very specific in what it carries across the membrane. These proteins are sensitive to inhibitors that react with protein side chains.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">Water is essential for all physiological activities of the plant and plays a very important role in all living organisms. It provides the medium in which most substances are dissolved. The protoplasm of the cells is nothing but water in which different molecules are dissolved and (several particles) suspended. A watermelon has over 92 per cent water; most herbaceous plants have only about 10 to 15 per cent of its fresh weight as dry matter. Of course, distribution of water within a plant varies &ndash; woody parts have relatively very little water, while soft parts mostly contain water. A seed may appear dry but it still has water &ndash; otherwise it would not be alive and respiring!</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">Terrestrial plants take up huge amount water daily but most of it is lost to the air through evaporation from the leaves, i.e.,</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">transpiration</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">. A mature corn plant absorbs almost three litres of water in a day, while a mustard plant absorbs water equal to its own weight in about 5 hours. Because of this high demand for water, it is not surprising that water is often the limiting factor for plant growth and productivity in both agricultural and natural environments.</span></p>

In liquid and gaseous form they are in random motion that is both rapid and constant. The greater the concentration of water in a system, the greater is its kinetic energy or â€˜water potentialâ€™. Hence, it is obvious that pure water will have the greatest water potential. If two systems containing water are in contact, random movement of water molecules will result in net movement of water molecules from the system with higher energy to the one with lower energy. Thus water will move from the system containing water at higher water potential</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">to the one having low water potential</span><span class="calibre8" lang="en-GB">.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">This process of movement of substances down a gradient of free energy is called diffusion.

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">Imbibition</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">is a special type of diffusion when water is absorbed by solids &ndash; colloids &ndash; causing them to enormously increase in volume. The classical examples of imbibition are absorption of water by seeds and dry wood. The pressure that is produced by the swelling of wood had been used by prehistoric man to split rocks and boulders. If it were not for the pressure due to imbibition, seedlings would not have been able to emerge out of the soil into the open; they probably would not have been able to establish!</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">Imbibition is also diffusion since water movement is along a concentration gradient; the seeds and other such materials have almost no water hence they absorb water easily. Water potential gradient between the absorbent and the liquid imbibed is essential for imbibition. In addition, for any substance to imbibe any liquid, affinity between the adsorb</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">ant and the liquid is also a pre-requisite.</span></p>

      <p class="conceptheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">11.3 Long Distance Transport of Water</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">At some earlier stage you might have carried out an experiment where you had placed a twig bearing white flowers in coloured water and had watched it turn colour. On examining the cut end of the twig after a few hours you had noted the region through which the coloured water moved. That experiment very easily demonstrates that the path of water movement is through the vascular bundles, more specifically, the xylem. Now we have to go further and try and understand the mechanism of movement of water and other substances up a plant.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">Long distance transport of substances within a plant cannot be by diffusion alone. Diffusion is a slow process. It can account for only short distance movement of molecules. For example, the movement of a molecule across a typical plant cell (about 50 Âµm) takes approximately 2.5 s.</span> <span class="calibre8" lang="en-GB">At this rate, can you calculate how many years it would take for the movement of molecules over a distance of 1 m within a plant by diffusion alone?</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">In large and complex organisms, often substances have to be moved across very large distances. Sometimes the sites of production or absorption and sites of storage are too far from each other; diffusion or active transport would not suffice. Special long distance transport systems become necessary so as to move substances across long distances and at a much faster rate. Water and minerals, and food are generally moved by a</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">mass</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">or</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">bulk flow</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">system. Mass flow is the movement of substances in bulk or</span> <span class="calibre8" lang="en-GB">en masse</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">from one point to another as a result of pressure differences between the two points. It is a characteristic of mass flow that substances, whether in solution or in suspension, are swept along at the same pace, as in a flowing river. This is unlike diffusion where different substances move independently depending on their concentration gradients. Bulk flow can be achieved either through a positive hydrostatic pressure gradient (e.g., a garden hose) or a negative hydrostatic pressure gradient (e.g., suction through a straw).</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">The bulk movement of substances through the conducting or vascular tissues of plants is called</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">translocation.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">Do you remember studying cross sections of roots, stems and leaves of higher plants and studying the vascular system? The higher plants have highly specialised vascular tissues &ndash; xylem and phloem. Xylem is associated with translocation of mainly water, mineral salts, some organic nitrogen and hormones, from roots to the aerial parts of the plants. The phloem translocates a variety of organic and inorganic solutes, mainly from the leaves to other parts of the plants.</span></p>

The responsibility of absorption of water and minerals is more specifically the function of the root hairs that are present in millions at the tips of the roots. Root hairs are thin-walled slender extensions of root epidermal cells that greatly increase the surface area for absorption. Water is absorbed along with mineral solutes, by the root hairs, purely by diffusion. Once water is absorbed by the root hairs, it can move deeper into root layers by two distinct pathways:</p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="calibre8">The</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">apoplast</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">is the system of adjacent cell walls that is continuous throughout the plant, except at the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">casparian</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">strips of the endodermis in the roots (Figure 11.6). The apoplastic movement of water occurs exclusively through the intercellular spaces and the walls of the cells. Movement through the apoplast does not involve crossing the cell</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">membrane. This movement is dependent on the gradient. The apoplast does not provide any barrier to water movement and water movement is through mass flow. As water evaporates into the intercellular spaces or the atmosphere, tension develop in the continuous stream of water in the apoplast, hence mass flow of water occurs due to the adhesive and cohesive properties of water.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">The</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">symplastic</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">system is the system of interconnected protoplasts.

Water has to enter the cells through the cell membrane, hence the movement is relatively slower. Movement is again down a potential gradient. Symplastic movement may be aided by cytoplasmic streaming. You may have observed cytoplasmic streaming in cells of the</span> <span class="calibre8" lang="en-GB">Hydrilla</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">leaf; the movement of chloroplast due to streaming is easily visible.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">Most of the water flow in the roots occurs via the apoplast since the cortical cells are loosely packed, and hence offer no resistance to water movement. However, the inner boundary of the cortex, the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">endodermis</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">, is impervious to water because of a band of suberised matrix called the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">casparian strip</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">. Water molecules are unable to penetrate the layer, so they are directed to wall regions that are not suberised, into the cells proper through the membranes. The water then moves through the symplast and again crosses a membrane to reach the cells of the xylem. The movement of water through the root layers is ultimately symplastic in the endodermis. This is the only way water and other solutes can enter the vascular cylinder.</span></p>

This positive pressure is called</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">root pressure,</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">and can be responsible for pushing up water to small heights in the stem.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">How can we see that root pressure exists? Choose a small soft-stemmed plant and on a day, when there is plenty of atmospheric moisture, cut the stem horizontally near the base with a sharp blade, early in the morning. You will soon see drops of solution ooze out of the cut stem; this comes out due to the positive root pressure. If you fix a rubber tube to the cut stem as a sleeve you can actually collect and measure the rate of exudation, and also determine the composition of the exudates. Effects of root pressure is also observable at night and early morning when evaporation is low, and excess water collects in the form of droplets around special openings of veins near the tip of grass blades, and leaves of many herbaceous parts. Such water loss in its liquid phase is known as</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">guttation</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">Root pressure can, at best, only provide a modest push in the overall process of water transport. They obviously do not play a major role in water movement up tall trees. The greatest contribution of root pressure may be to re-establish the continuous chains of water molecules in the xylem which often break under the enormous tensions created by transpiration. Root pressure does not account for the majority of water transport; most plants meet their need by transpiratory pull.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">Despite the absence of a heart or a circulatory system in plants, the flow of water upward through the xylem in plants can achieve fairly high rates, up to 15 metres per hour. How is this movement accomplished? A long standing question is, whether water is â€˜pushedâ€™ or â€˜pulledâ€™ through the plant. Most researchers agree that water is mainly â€˜pulledâ€™ through the plant, and that the driving force for this process is transpiration from the leaves. This is referred to as the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">cohesion-tension</span><span class="calibre8" lang="en-GB">-</span><span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">transpiration pull model</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">of water transport. But, what generates this transpirational pull?</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">Water is transient in plants. Less than 1 per cent of the water reaching the leaves is used in photosynthesis and plant growth.

      <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">Transpiration is the evaporative loss of water by plants. It occurs mainly through the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">stomata</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">in the leaves. Besides the loss of water vapour in transpiration, exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the leaf also occurs through pores called stomata (sing. : stoma). Normally stomata are open in the day time and close during the night. The immediate cause of the opening or closing of the stomata is a change in the turgidity of the</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">guard cells</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">. The inner wall of each guard cell, towards the pore or</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">stomatal aperture,</span> <span class="calibre8">is thick and elastic. When turgidity increases within the two guard cells flanking each stomatal aperture or pore, the thin outer walls bulge out and force the inner walls into a crescent shape. The opening of the stoma is also aided due to the orientation of the microfibrils in the cell walls of the guard cells. Cellulose microfibrils are oriented radially rather than longitudinally making it easier for the stoma to open. When the guard cells lose turgor, due to water loss (or water stress) the elastic inner walls regain their original shape, the guard cells become flaccid and the stoma closes.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US">Usually the lower surface of a dorsiventral (often dicotyledonous) leaf has a greater number of stomata while in an isobilateral (often monocotyledonous) leaf they are about equal on both surfaces. Transpiration is affected by several external factors: temperature, light, humidity, wind speed. Plant factors that affect transpiration include number and distribution of stomata, per cent of open stomata, water status of the plant, canopy structure etc.</p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">The transpiration driven ascent of xylem sap depends mainly on the following physical properties of water:</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US">The process of photosynthesis requires water. The system of xylem vessels from the root to the leaf vein can supply the needed water. But what force does a plant use to move water molecules into the leaf parenchyma cells where they are needed? As water evaporates through the stomata, since the thin film of water over the cells is continuous, it results in pulling of water, molecule by molecule, into the leaf from the xylem. Also, because of lower concentration of water vapour in the atmosphere as compared to the substomatal cavity and intercellular spaces, water diffuses into the surrounding air. This creates a â€˜pullâ€™ (Figure 11.9).</p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="calibre8">Measurements reveal that the forces generated by transpiration can create pressures sufficient to lift a xylem sized column of water over 130 metres high.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">Unlike water, all minerals cannot be passively absorbed by the roots. Two factors account for this: (i) minerals are present in the soil as charged particles (ions) which cannot move across cell membranes and (ii) the concentration of minerals in the soil is usually lower than the concentration of minerals in the root. Therefore, most minerals must enter the root by</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">active absorption</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">into the cytoplasm of epidermal cells. This needs energy in the form of ATP. The active uptake of ions is partly responsible for the water potential gradient in roots, and therefore for the uptake of water by osmosis. Some ions also move into the epidermal cells passively.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">Ions are absorbed from the soil by both passive and active transport. Specific proteins in the membranes of root hair cells actively pump ions from the soil into the cytoplasms of the epidermal cells.

      <p class="subheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">11.5.2 Translocation of Mineral Ions</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">After the ions have reached xylem through active or passive uptake, or a combination of the two, their further transport up the stem to all parts of the plant is through the transpiration stream.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US">The chief sinks for the mineral elements are the growing regions of the plant, such as the apical and lateral meristems, young leaves, developing flowers, fruits and seeds, and the storage organs. Unloading of mineral ions occurs at the fine vein endings through diffusion and active uptake by these cells.</p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">Mineral ions are frequently remobilised, particularly from older, senescing parts. Older dying leaves export much of their mineral content to younger leaves. Similarly, before leaf fall in decidous plants, minerals are removed to other parts. Elements most readily mobilised are phosphorus, sulphur, nitrogen and potassium. Some elements that are structural components like calcium are not remobilised.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">An analysis of the xylem exudates shows that though some of the nitrogen travels as inorganic ions, much of it is carried in the organic form as amino acids and related compounds. Similarly, small amounts of P and S are carried as organic compounds. In addition, small amount of exchange of materials does take place between xylem and phloem. Hence, it is not that we can clearly make a distinction and say categorically that xylem transports only inorganic nutrients while phloem transports only organic materials, as was traditionally believed.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">Food, primarily sucrose, is transported by the vascular tissue phloem from a source to a sink. Usually the source is understood to be that part of the plant which synthesises the food</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">, i.e., the leaf, and sink, the part that needs or stores the food. But, the source and sink may be reversed depending on the season, or the plantâ€™s needs. Sugar stored in roots may be mobilised to become a source of food in the early spring when the buds of trees, act as sink; they need energy for growth and development of the photosynthetic apparatus. Since the source-sink relationship is variable, the direction of movement in the phloem can be upwards or downwards, i.e.,</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">bi-directional</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">. This contrasts with that of the xylem where the movement is always</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">unidirectional,</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">i.e., upwards. Hence, unlike one-way flow of water in transpiration, food&nbsp;in phloem sap can be transported in any required direction so long&nbsp;as there is a source of sugar and a sink able to use, store or remove&nbsp;the sugar.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">Phloem sap is mainly water and sucrose, but other sugars, hormones and amino acids are also transported or</span> <span class="calibre7" lang="en-GB">translocated</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">through phloem.</span></p>

      <p class="subheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">11.6.1 The Pressure Flow or Mass Flow Hypothesis</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US">The accepted mechanism used for the translocation of sugars from source to sink is called the pressure flow hypothesis. (see Figure 11.10). As glucose is prepared at the source (by photosynthesis) it is converted to sucrose (a dissacharide). The sugar is then moved in the form of sucrose into the companion cells and then into the living phloem sieve tube cells by active transport. This process of loading at the source produces a hypertonic condition in the phloem. Water in the adjacent xylem moves into the phloem by osmosis. As osmotic pressure builds up the phloem sap will move to areas of lower pressure. At the sink osmotic pressure must be reduced. Again active transport is necessary to move the sucrose out of the phloem sap and into the cells which will use the sugar &ndash; converting it into energy, starch, or cellulose. As sugars are removed, the osmotic pressure decreases and water moves out of the phloem.</p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style">To summarise, the movement of sugars in the phloem begins at the source, where sugars are loaded (actively transported) into a sieve tube. Loading of the phloem sets up a water potential gradient that facilitates the mass movement in the phloem.</p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">Phloem tissue is composed of sieve tube cells, which form long columns with holes in their end walls called sieve plates. Cytoplasmic strands pass through the holes in the sieve plates, so forming continuous filaments. As hydrostatic pressure in the phloem sieve tube increases, pressure flow begins, and the sap moves through the phloem. Meanwhile, at the sink, incoming sugars are actively transported out of the phloem and removed as complex carbohydrates. The loss of solute produces a high water potential in the phloem, and water passes out, returning eventually to xylem.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre8">A simple experiment, called girdling, was used to identify the tissues through which food is transported. On the trunk of a tree a ring of bark up to a depth of the phloem layer, can be carefully removed. In the absence of downward movement of food the portion of the bark above the ring on the stem becomes swollen after a few weeks. This simple experiment shows that phloem is the tissue responsible for translocation of food; and that transport takes place in one direction, i.e., towards the roots. This experiment can be performed by you easily.</span></p>

        <p class="subheading2" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">Summary</span></p>

        <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US">Plants obtain a variety of inorganic elements (ions) and salts from their surroundings especially from water and soil. The movement of these nutrients from environment into the plant as well as from one plant cell to another plant cell essentially involves movement across a cell membrane. Transport across cell membrane can be through diffusion, facilitated transport or active transport. Water and minerals absorbed by roots are transported by xylem and the organic material synthesised in the leaves is transported to other parts of plant through phloem.</p>

        <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US">Passive transport (diffusion, osmosis) and active transport are the two modes of nutrient transport across cell membranes in living organisms. In passive transport, nutrients move across the membrane by diffusion, without any use of energy as it is always down the concentration gradient and hence entropy driven. This diffusion of substances depends on their size, solubility in water or organic solvents. Osmosis is the special type of diffusion of water across a semi-permeable membrane which depends on pressure gradient and concentration gradient. In active transport, energy in the form of ATP is utilised to pump molecules against a concentration gradient across membranes. Water potential is the potential energy of water which helps in the movement of water. It is determined by solute potential and pressure potential. The behaviour of the cells depends on the surrounding solution. If the surrounding solution of the cell is hypertonic, it gets plasmolysed. The absorption of water by seeds and drywood takes place by a special type of diffusion called imbibition.</p>

        <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US">In higher plants, there is a vascular system, xylem and phloem, responsible for translocation. Water minerals and food cannot be moved within the body of a plant by diffusion alone. They are therefore, transported by a mass flow system &ndash; movement of substance in bulk from one point to another as a result of pressure differences between the two points.</p>

        <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US">Water absorbed by root hairs moves deeper into the root by two distinct pathways, i.e., apoplast and symplast. Various ions, and water from soil can be transported upto a small height in stems by root pressure. Transpiration pull model is the most acceptable to explain the transport of water. Transpiration is the loss of water in the form of vapours from the plant parts through stomata. Temperature, light, humidity, wind speed and number of stomata affect the rate of transpiration. Excess water is also removed through tips of leaves of plants by guttation.</p>

        <p class="no-paragraph-style" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre8" lang="en-GB">Phloem is responsible for transport of food (primarily) sucrose from the source to the sink. The translocation in phloem is bi-directional; the source-sink relationship is variable. The translocation in phloem is explained by the pressure-flow hypothesis.</span></p>
