The neural coordination is fast but short-lived. As the nerve fibres do not innervate all cells of the body and the cellular functions need to be continuously regulated; a special kind of coordination and integration has to be provided. This function is carried out by hormones. The neural system and the endocrine system jointly coordinate and regulate the physiological functions in the body.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Endocrine glands lack ducts and are hence, called ductless glands. Their secretions are called hormones. The classical definition of hormone as a chemical produced by endocrine glands and released into the blood and transported to a distantly located target organ has current scientific definition as follows:</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">Hormones are non-nutrient chemicals which act as intercellular messengers and are produced in trace amounts</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. The new definition covers a number of new molecules in addition to the hormones secreted by the organised endocrine glands. Invertebrates possess very simple endocrine systems with few hormones whereas a large number of chemicals act as hormones and provide coordination in the vertebrates. The human endocrine system is described here.</span></p>

    <p class="text"><span class="calibre6">The endocrine glands and hormone producing diffused tissues/cells located in different parts of our body constitute the endocrine system. Pituitary, pineal, thyroid, adrenal, pancreas, parathyroid, thymus and gonads (testis in males and ovary in females) are the organised endocrine bodies in our body (Figure 22.1). In addition to these, some other organs, e.g., gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, heart also produce hormones. A brief account of the structure and functions of all major endocrine glands and hypothalamus of the human body is given in the following sections.<br class="calibre3" /></span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US">As you know, the hypothalamus is the basal part of diencephalon, forebrain (Figure 22.1) and it regulates a wide spectrum of body functions. It contains several groups of neurosecretory cells called nuclei which produce hormones. These hormones regulate the synthesis and secretion of pituitary hormones. However, the hormones produced by hypothalamus are of two types, the releasing hormones (which stimulate secretion of pituitary hormones) and the inhibiting hormones (which inhibit secretions of pituitary hormones). For example a hypothalamic hormone called Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates the pituitary synthesis and release of gonadotrophins. On the other hand, somatostatin from the hypothalamus inhibits the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. These hormones originating in the hypothalamic neurons, pass through axons and are released from their nerve endings. These hormones reach the pituitary gland through a portal circulatory system and regulate the functions of the anterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary is under the direct neural regulation of the hypothalamus (Figure 22.2).</p>

    <p class="subheading">22.2.2 The Pituitary Gland</p>

    <p class="heading"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">The pituitary gland is located in a bony cavity called sella tursica and is attached to hypothalamus by a stalk (Figure 22.2). It is divided anatomically into an</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">adenohypophysis</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">and a</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">neurohypophysis</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. Adenohypophysis consists of two portions, pars distalis and pars intermedia. The pars distalis region of pituitary, commonly called anterior pituitary, produces</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">growth hormone</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">(GH),</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">prolactin</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">(PRL),</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">thyroid stimulating hormone</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">(TSH),</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">adrenocorticotrophic hormone</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">(ACTH),</span><span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">luteinizing hormone</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">(LH) and</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">follicle stimulating hormone</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">(FSH). Pars intermedia secretes only one hormone called</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">melanocyte stimulating hormone</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">(MSH). However, in humans, the pars intermedia is almost merged with pars distalis.

    <p class="text"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Over-secretion of GH stimulates abnormal growth of the body leading to gigantism and low secretion of GH results in stunted growth resulting in pituitary dwarfism. Prolactin regulates the growth of the mammary glands and formation of milk in them. TSH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. ACTH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones called</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">glucocorticoids</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">from the adrenal cortex. LH and FSH stimulate gonadal activity and hence are called</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">gonadotrophins</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. In males, LH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of hormones called</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">androgens</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">from testis. In males, FSH and androgens regulate spermatogenesis. In females, LH induces ovulation of fully mature follicles (graafian follicles) and maintains the corpus luteum, formed from the remnants of the graafian follicles after ovulation. FSH stimulates growth and development of the ovarian follicles in females. MSH acts on the melanocytes (melanin containing cells) and regulates pigmentation of the skin. Oxytocin acts on the smooth muscles of our body and stimulates their contraction. In females, it stimulates a vigorous contraction of uterus at the time of child birth, and milk ejection from the mammary gland. Vasopressin acts mainly at the kidney and stimulates resorption of water and electrolytes by the distal tubules and thereby reduces loss of water through urine (diuresis). Hence, it is also called as</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">anti-diuretic hormone</span> <span class="calibre6">(ADH).</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">The thyroid gland is composed of two lobes which are located on either side of the trachea (Figure 22.3). Both the lobes are interconnected with a thin flap of connective tissue called isthmus.

Iodine is essential for the normal rate of hormone synthesis in the thyroid. Deficiency of iodine in our diet results in</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">hypothyroidism</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">and enlargement of the thyroid gland, commonly called</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">goitre</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. Hypothyroidism during pregnancy causes defective development and maturation of the growing baby leading to stunted growth (cretinism), mental retardation, low intelligence quotient, abnormal skin, deaf-mutism, etc. In adult women, hypothyroidism may cause menstrual cycle to become irregular. Due to cancer of the thyroid gland or due to development of nodules of the thyroid glands, the rate of synthesis and secretion of the thyroid hormones is increased to abnormal high levels leading to a condition called</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">hyperthyroidism</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">which adversely affects the body physiology.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Thyroid hormones play an important role in the regulation of the basal metabolic rate. These hormones also support the process of red blood cell formation. Thyroid hormones control the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Maintenance of water and electrolyte balance is also influenced by thyroid hormones. Thyroid gland also secretes a protein hormone called thyrocalcitonin (TCT) which regulates the blood calcium levels.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US">Androgens regulate the development, maturation and functions of the male accessory sex organs like epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, urethra etc. These hormones stimulate muscular growth, growth of facial and axillary hair, aggressiveness, low pitch of voice etc. Androgens play a major stimulatory role in the process of spermatogenesis (formation of spermatozoa). Androgens act on the central neural system and influence the male sexual behaviour (libido). These hormones produce anabolic (synthetic) effects on protein and carbohydrate metabolism.</p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Females have a pair of ovaries located in the abdomen (Figure 22.1). Ovary is the primary female sex organ which produces one ovum during each menstrual cycle. In addition, ovary also produces two groups of steroid hormones called</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">estrogen</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">and</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">progesterone</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. Ovary is composed of ovarian follicles and stromal tissues. The estrogen is synthesised and secreted mainly by the growing ovarian follicles. After ovulation, the ruptured follicle is converted to a structure called</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">corpus luteum</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">, which secretes mainly</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">progesterone</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US">Estrogens produce wide ranging actions such as stimulation of growth and activities of female secondary sex organs, development of growing ovarian follicles, appearance of female secondary sex characters (e.g., high pitch of voice, etc.), mammary gland development. Estrogens also regulate female sexual behaviour.</p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US">Progesterone supports pregnancy. Progesterone also acts on the mammary glands and stimulates the formation of alveoli (sac-like structures which store milk) and milk secretion.</p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Now you know about the endocrine glands and their hormones. However, as mentioned earlier, hormones are also secreted by some tissues which are not endocrine glands. For example, the atrial wall of our heart secretes a very important peptide hormone called</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">atrial natriuretic factor</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">(ANF), which decreases blood pressure. When blood pressure is increased, ANF is secreted which causes dilation of the blood vessels. This reduces the blood pressure.</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">The juxtaglomerular cells of kidney produce a peptide hormone called</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">erythropoietin</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">which stimulates erythropoiesis (formation of RBC).</span></p>

    <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Endocrine cells present in different parts of the gastro-intestinal tract secrete four major peptide hormones, namely</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">gastrin</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">,</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">secretin</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">,</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">cholecystokinin</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">(CCK) and</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">gastric inhibitory peptide</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">(GIP). Gastrin acts on the gastric glands and stimulates the secretion of hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen. Secretin acts on the exocrine pancreas and stimulates secretion of water and bicarbonate ions. CCK acts on both pancreas and gall bladder and stimulates the secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile juice, respectively. GIP inhibits gastric secretion and motility. Several other non-endocrine tissues secrete hormones called</span> <span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">growth factors.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">These factors are essential for the normal growth of tissues and their repairing/regeneration.</span></p>

        <p class="text"></p>

        <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">There are special chemicals which act as hormones and provide chemical coordination, integration and regulation in the human body. These hormones regulate metabolism, growth and development of our organs, the endocrine glands or certain cells. The endocrine system is composed of hypothalamus, pituitary and pineal, thyroid, adrenal, pancreas, parathyroid, thymus and gonads (testis and ovary). In addition to these, some other organs, e.g., gastrointestinal tract, kidney, heart etc., also produce hormones. The pituitary gland is divided into three major parts, which are called as pars distalis, pars intermedia and pars nervosa. Pars distalis produces six trophic hormones. Pars intermedia secretes only one hormone, while pars nervosa (neurohypophysis) secretes two hormones. The pituitary hormones regulate the growth and development of somatic tissues and activities of peripheral endocrine glands. Pineal gland secretes melatonin, which plays a very important role in the regulation of 24-hour (diurnal) rhythms of our body (e.g., rhythms of sleep and state of being awake, body temperature, etc.). The thyroid gland hormones play an important role in the regulation of the basal metabolic rate, development and maturation of the central neural system, erythropoiesis, metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats, menstrual cycle. Another thyroid hormone, i.e., thyrocalcitonin regulates calcium levels in our blood by decreasing it. The parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH) which increases the blood Ca</span><span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-GB">2+</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">levels and plays a major role in calcium homeostasis. The thymus gland secretes thymosins which play a major role in the differentiation of T-lymphocytes, which provide cell-mediated immunity. In addition, thymosins also increase the production of antibodies to provide humoral immunity. The adrenal gland is composed of the centrally located adrenal medulla and the outer adrenal cortex. The adrenal medulla secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones increase alertness, pupilary dilation, piloerection, sweating, heart beat, strength of heart contraction, rate of respiration, glycogenolysis, lipolysis, proteolysis. The adrenal cortex secretes glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. Glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, proteolysis, erythropoiesis, cardio-vascular system, blood pressure, and glomerular filtration rate and inhibit inflammatory reactions by suppressing the immune response. Mineralocorticoids regulate water and electrolyte contents of the body. The endocrine pancreas secretes glucagon and insulin. Glucagon stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis resulting in hyperglycemia. Insulin stimulates cellular glucose uptake and utilisation, and glycogenesis resulting in hypoglycemia. Insulin deficiency and/or insulin resistance result in a disease called diabetes mellitus.</span></p>

        <p class="text" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">The testis secretes androgens, which stimulate the development, maturation and functions of the male accessory sex organs, appearance of the male secondary sex characters, spermatogenesis, male sexual behaviour, anabolic pathways and erythropoiesis. The ovary secretes estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen stimulates growth and development of female accessory sex organs and secondary sex characters. Progesterone plays a major role in the maintenance of pregnancy as well as in mammary gland development and lactation. The atrial wall of the heart produces atrial natriuretic factor which decreases the blood pressure. Kidney produces erythropoietin which stimulates erythropoiesis. The gastrointestinal tract secretes gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin and gastric inhibitory peptide. These hormones regulate the secretion of digestive juices and help in digestion.</span></p>
