    <p class="chapter-index">The basic needs of all living organisms are essentially the same. They require macromolecules, such as carbohydrates, proteins and fats, and water and minerals for their growth and development.</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">This chapter focusses mainly on inorganic plant nutrition, wherein you will study the methods to identify elements essential to growth and development of plants and the criteria for establishing the essentiality. You will also study the role of the essential elements, their major deficiency symptoms and the mechanism of absorption of these essential elements. The chapter also introduces you briefly to the significance and the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation.</span></p>

    <p class="conceptheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">12.1 Methods to Study the Mineral Requirements of Plants</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">In 1860, Julius von Sachs, a prominent German botanist, demonstrated, for the first time, that plants could be grown to maturity in a defined nutrient solution in complete absence of soil. This technique of growing plants in a nutrient solution is known as</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">hydroponics</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. Since then, a number of improvised methods have been employed to try and determine the mineral nutrients essential for plants. The essence of all these methods involves the culture of plants in a soil-free, defined mineral solution. These methods require purified water and mineral nutrient salts.</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Can you explain why this is so essential?</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index"><span class="calibre6">After a series of experiments in which the roots of the plants were immersed in nutrient solutions and wherein an element was added / removed or given in varied concentration, a mineral solution suitable for the plant growth was obtained. By this method, essential elements were identified and their deficiency symptoms discovered. Hydroponics has been successfully employed as a technique for the commercial production of vegetables such as tomato, seedless cucumber and lettuce. It must be emphasised that the nutrient solutions must be adequately aerated to obtain the optimum growth. What would happen if solutions were poorly aerated? Diagrammatic views of the hydroponic technique is given in Figures 12.1 and 12.2.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Most of the minerals present in soil can enter plants through roots. In fact, more than sixty elements of the 105 discovered so far are found in different plants. Some plant species accumulate selenium, some others gold, while some plants growing near nuclear test sites take up radioactive strontium. There are techniques that are able to detect the minerals even at a very low concentration (10</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">-8</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">g/mL). The question is, whether all the diverse mineral elements present in a plant, for example, gold and selenium as mentioned above, are really necessary for plants? How do we decide what is essential for plants and what is not?</span></p>

    <p class="subheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">12.2.1 Criteria for Essentiality</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">The criteria for essentiality of an element are given below:</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">(a) The element must be absolutely necessary for supporting normal growth and reproduction. In the absence of the element the plants do not complete their life cycle or set the seeds.</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">(b) The requirement of the element must be specific and not replaceable by another element. In other words, deficiency of any one element cannot be met by supplying some other element.</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">(c) The element must be directly involved</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">in the metabolism of the plant.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">Based upon the above criteria only a few elements have been found to be absolutely essential for plant growth and metabolism. These elements are further divided into two broad categories based on their quantitative requirements.</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">(i) Macronutrients, and</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">(ii) Micronutrients</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Macronutrients</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">are generally present in plant tissues in large amounts (in excess of 10 mmole Kg</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre7">&ndash;1</sup></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">of dry matter). The macronutrients include carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulphur, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Of these, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are mainly obtained from CO</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre8">2</sub></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">and H</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre8">2</sub></span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">O, while the others are absorbed from the soil as mineral nutrition.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Micronutrients</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">or trace elements, are needed in very small amounts (less than 10 mmole Kg</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre7">&ndash;1</sup></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">of dry matter). These include iron, manganese, copper, molybdenum, zinc, boron, chlorine and nickel.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">In addition to the 17 essential elements named above, there are some beneficial elements such as sodium, silicon, cobalt and selenium. They are required by higher plants.</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">Essential elements can also be grouped into four broad categories on the basis of their diverse functions. These categories are:</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">(</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">i) Essential elements as components of biomolecules and hence structural elements of cells (e.g.</span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen).</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">(ii) Essential elements that are components of energy-related chemical compounds in plants (e.g., magnesium in chlorophyll and phosphorous in ATP).</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">( iii) Essential elements that activate or inhibit enzymes, for example Mg</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre7">2+</sup></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">is an activator for both ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase, both of which are critical enzymes in photosynthetic carbon fixation; Zn</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre7">2+</sup></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">is an activator of alcohol dehydrogenase and</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Mo</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">of nitrogenase during nitrogen metabolism.</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">Can you name a few more elements that fall in this category?</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">For this, you will need to recollect some of the biochemical pathways you have studied earlier.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">( iv) Some essential elements can alter the osmotic potential of a cell. Potassium plays an important role in the opening and closing of stomata. You may recall the role of minerals as solutes in determining the water potential of a cell.</span></p>

    <p class="subheading" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">12.2.2 Role of Macro- and Micro-nutrients</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">Essential elements perform several functions. They participate in various metabolic processes in the plant cells such as permeability of cell membrane, maintenance of osmotic concentration of cell sap, electron-transport systems, buffering action, enzymatic activity and act as major constituents of macromolecules and co-enzymes.</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">Various forms and functions of essential nutrient elements are given below.</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><b class="calibre9">Nitrogen :</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">This is the essential nutrient element required by plants in the greatest amount.

Nitrogen is required by all parts of a plant, particularly the meristematic tissues and the metabolically active cells. Nitrogen is one of the major constituents of proteins, nucleic acids, vitamins and hormones.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><b class="calibre9">Phosphorus:</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Phosphorus is absorbed by the plants from soil in the form of phosphate ions (either as <span class="calibre6"><img alt="951.png" class="img_tp" src="images/000012.png" /></span> or <span class="calibre6"><img alt="962.png" class="img_tp" src="images/000019.png" /></span>). Phosphorus is a constituent of cell membranes, certain proteins, all nucleic acids and nucleotides, and is required for all phosphorylation reactions.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><b class="calibre9">Potassium:</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">It is absorbed as potassium ion (K</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre7">+</sup></span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">). In plants, this is required in more abundant quantities in the meristematic tissues, buds, leaves and root tips. Potassium helps to maintain an anion-cation balance in cells and is involved in protein synthesis, opening and closing of stomata, activation of enzymes and in the maintenance of the turgidity of cells.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><b class="calibre9">Calcium:</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Plant absorbs calcium from the soil in the form of calcium ions (Ca</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre7">2+</sup></span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">). Calcium is required by meristematic and differentiating tissues. During cell division it is used in the synthesis of cell wall, particularly as calcium pectate in the middle lamella. It is also needed during the formation of mitotic spindle. It accumulates in older leaves. It is involved in the normal functioning of the cell membranes. It activates certain enzymes and plays an important role in regulating metabolic activities.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><b class="calibre9">Magnesium:</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">It is absorbed by plants in the form of divalent Mg</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre7">2+</sup></span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">. It activates the enzymes of respiration, photosynthesis and are involved in the synthesis of DNA and RNA. Magnesium is a constituent of the ring structure of chlorophyll and helps to maintain the ribosome structure.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><b class="calibre9">Sulphur:</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Plants obtain sulphur in the form of sulphate <span class="calibre6"><img alt="972.png" class="img_tp" src="images/000007.png" /></span>. Sulphur is present in two amino acids &ndash; cysteine and methionine and is the main constituent of several coenzymes, vitamins (thiamine, biotin, Coenzyme A) and ferredoxin.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><b class="calibre9">Iron:</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Plants obtain iron in the form of ferric ions (Fe</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre7">3+</sup></span><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">). It is required in larger amounts in comparison to other micronutrients. It is an important constituent of proteins involved in the transfer of electrons like ferredoxin and cytochromes.

It activates many enzymes involved in photosynthesis, respiration and nitrogen metabolism. The best defined function of manganese is in the splitting of water to liberate oxygen during photosynthesis.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><b class="calibre9">Zinc:</b></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Plants obtain zinc as Zn</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre7">2+</sup></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">ions.

    <p class="subheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">12.2.3 Deficiency Symptoms of Essential Elements</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Whenever the supply of an essential element becomes limited, plant growth is retarded. The concentration of the essential element below which plant growth is retarded is termed as</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">critical concentration.</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">The element is said to be deficient when present below the critical concentration.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Since each element has one or more specific structural or functional role in plants, in the absence of any particular element, plants show certain morphological changes. These morphological changes are indicative of certain element deficiencies and are called deficiency symptoms. The deficiency symptoms vary from element to element and they disappear when the deficient mineral nutrient is provided to the plant. However, if deprivation continues, it may eventually lead to the death of the plant. The parts of the plants that show the deficiency symptoms also depend on the mobility of the element in the plant. For elements that are actively mobilised within the plants and exported to young developing tissues, the deficiency symptoms tend to appear first in the older tissues. For example, the deficiency symptoms of nitrogen, potassium and magnesium are visible first in the senescent leaves. In the older leaves, biomolecules containing these elements are broken down, making these elements available for mobilising to younger leaves.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">The deficiency symptoms tend to appear first in the young tissues whenever the elements are relatively immobile and are not transported out of the mature organs, for example, element like calcium</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">is a part&nbsp;of the structural component of the cell and hence is not easily released. This aspect of mineral nutrition of plants is of a great significance and importance to agriculture and horticulture.</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US">The kind of deficiency symptoms shown in plants include chlorosis, necrosis, stunted plant growth, premature fall of leaves and buds, and inhibition of cell division. Chlorosis is the loss of chlorophyll leading to yellowing in leaves. This symptom is caused by the deficiency of elements N, K, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Zn and Mo. Likewise, necrosis, or death of tissue, particularly leaf tissue, is due to the deficiency of Ca, Mg, Cu, K. Lack or low level of N, K, S, Mo causes an inhibition of cell division. Some elements like N, S, Mo delay flowering if their concentration in plants is low.</p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">You can see from the above that the deficiency of any element can cause multiple symptoms and that the same symptoms may be caused by the deficiency of one of several different elements. Hence, to identify the deficient element, one has to study all the symptoms developed in all the various parts of the plant and compare them with the available standard tables. We must also be aware that different plants also respond differently to the deficiency of the same element.</span></p>

    <p class="subheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-GB">12.2.4 Toxicity of Micronutrients</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">The requirement of micronutrients is always in low amounts while their moderate decrease causes the deficiency symptoms and a moderate increase causes toxicity. In other words, there is a narrow range of concentration at which the elements are optimum. Any mineral ion concentration in tissues that reduces the dry weight of tissues by about 10 per cent is considered toxic. Such critical concentrations vary widely among different micronutrients. The toxicity symptoms are difficult to identify. Toxicity levels for any element also vary for different plants. Many a times, excess of an element may inhibit the uptake of another element. For example, the prominent symptom of manganese toxicity</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">is the appearance of brown spots surrounded by chlorotic veins. It is important to know that manganese competes with iron and magnesium for uptake and with magnesium for binding with enzymes. Manganese also inhibit calcium translocation in shoot apex. Therefore, excess of manganese may, in fact, induce deficiencies of iron, magnesium and calcium. Thus, what appears as symptoms of manganese toxicity may actually be the deficiency symptoms of iron, magnesium and calcium. Can this knowledge be of some importance to a farmer? a gardener? or even for you in your kitchen-garden?</span></p>

    <p class="conceptheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">12.3 Mechanism of Absorption of Elements</span></p>

    <p class="chapter-index" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">Much of the studies on mechanism of absorption of elements by plants has been carried out in isolated cells, tissues or organs. These studies revealed that the process of absorption can be demarcated into two main phases. In the first phase, an initial rapid uptake of ions into the ‘free space’ or ‘outer space’ of cells &ndash; the apoplast, is passive. In the second phase of uptake, the ions are taken in slowly into the ‘inner space’ &ndash; the symplast of the cells. The passive movement of ions into the apoplast usually occurs through ion-channels, the trans-membrane proteins that function as selective pores. On the other hand, the entry or exit of ions to and from the symplast requires the expenditure of metabolic energy, which is an</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">active</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">process. The movement of ions is usually called</span> <span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB">flux;</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">the inward movement into the cells is influx and the outward movement, efflux. You have read the aspects of mineral nutrient uptake and translocation in plants in Chapter 11.</span></p>

    <p class="conceptheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">12.4 Translocation of Solutes</span></p>

The root-hairs curl and the bacteria invade the root-hair.

Then the bacteria are released from the thread into the cells which leads to the differentiation of specialised nitrogen fixing cells.

The enzyme nitrogenase is a Mo-Fe protein and catalyses the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, (Figure 12.5) the first stable product of nitrogen fixation. The reaction is as follows:</p>

    <p class="chapter-index"><span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">The enzyme nitrogenase is highly sensitive to the molecular oxygen; it requires anaerobic conditions. The nodules have adaptations that ensure that the enzyme is protected from oxygen. To protect these enzymes, the nodule contains an oxygen scavenger called leg-haemoglobin. It is interesting to note that these microbes live as aerobes under free-living conditions (where nitrogenase is not operational), but during nitrogen-fixing events, they become anaerobic (thus protecting the nitrogenase enzyme). You must have noticed in the above reaction that the ammonia synthesis by nitrogenease requires a very high input of energy (8 ATP for each NH</span><span class="calibre6" lang="en-GB"><sub class="calibre8">3</sub>&shy;</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="calibre6">produced).

Not all the mineral elements that they absorb are required by plants. Out of the more than 105 elements discovered so far, less than 21 are essential and beneficial for normal plant growth and development. The elements required in large quantities are called macronutrients while those required in less quantities or in trace are termed as micronutrients. These elements are either essential constituents of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, nucleic acid etc.,&nbsp;and/or take part in various metabolic processes. Deficiency of each of these essential elements may lead to symptoms called deficiency symptoms. Chlorosis, necrosis, stunted growth, impaired cell division, etc., are some prominent deficiency symptoms. Plants absorb minerals through roots by either passive or active processes.
