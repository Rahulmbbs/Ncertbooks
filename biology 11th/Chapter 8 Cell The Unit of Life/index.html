    <p class="calibre4"><span class="char-style-override1">Biology is the study of living organisms. The detailed description of their form and appearance only brought out their diversity. It is the cell theory that emphasised the unity underlying this diversity of forms, i.e., the cellular organisation of all life forms. A description of cell structure and cell growth by division is given in the chapters comprising this unit. Cell theory also created a sense of mystery around living phenomena, i.e., physiological and behavioural processes. This mystery was the requirement of integrity of cellular organisation for living phenomena to be demonstrated or observed. In studying and understanding the physiological and behavioural processes, one can take a physico-chemical approach and use cell-free systems to investigate. This approach enables us to describe the various processes in molecular terms. The approach is established by analysis of living tissues for elements and compounds. It will tell us what types of organic compounds are present in living organisms. In the next stage, one can ask the question: What are these compounds doing inside a cell? And, in what way they carry out gross physiological processes like digestion, excretion, memory, defense, recognition, etc. In other words we answer the question, what is the molecular basis of all physiological processes? It can also explain the abnormal processes that occur during any diseased condition. This physico-chemical approach to study and understand living organisms is called ‘Reductionist Biology’. The concepts and techniques of physics</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">and chemistry are applied to understand biology. In Chapter</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">9</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">of this unit, a brief description of biomolecules is provided.</span></p>

        <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">When you look around, you see both living and non-living things. You must have wondered and asked yourself &ndash; ‘what is it that makes an organism living, or what is it that an inanimate thing does not have which a living thing has’ ? The answer to this is the presence of the basic unit of life &ndash; the cell in all living organisms.<br class="calibre3" /></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">All organisms are composed of cells. Some are composed of a single cell and are called unicellular organisms while others, like us, composed of many cells, are called multicellular organisms.</p>

    <p class="conceptheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override3" lang="en-GB">8.1 What is a Cell?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Unicellular organisms are capable of (i) independent existence and<br class="calibre3" />
    (ii) performing the essential functions of life. Anything less than a complete structure of a cell does not ensure independent living. Hence, cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of all living organisms.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">Anton Von Leeuwenhoek first saw and described a live cell. Robert Brown later discovered the nucleus. The invention of the microscope and its improvement leading to the electron microscope revealed all the structural details of the cell.</span></p>

    <p class="conceptheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override3">8.2 Cell Theory</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">In 1838, Ma</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">tthias Schleiden, a German botanist, examined a large number of plants and observed that all plants are composed of different kinds of cells which form the tissues of the plant. At about the same time, Theodore Schwann (1839), a British Zoologist, studied different types of animal cells and reported that cells had a thin outer layer which is today known as the ‘plasma membrane’. He also concluded, based on his studies on plant tissues, that the presence of cell wall is a unique character of the plant cells. On the basis of this, Schwann proposed the hypothesis that the bodies of animals and plants are composed of cells and products of cells.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">Schleiden and Schwann together formulated the cell theory. This theory however, did not explain as to how new cells were formed. Rudolf Virchow (1855) first explained that cells divided and new cells are formed from pre-existing cells (</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">Omnis cellula-e cellula</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">). He modified the hypothesis of Schleiden and Schwann to give the cell theory a final shape. Cell theory as understood today is:</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">(i) all living organisms are composed of cells and products of cells.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">(ii) all cells arise from pre-existing cells.</span></p>

    <p class="conceptheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override3">8.3 An Overview of Cell</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">You have earlier observed cells in an onion peel and/or human cheek cells under the microscope. Let us recollect their structure. The onion cell which is a typical plant cell, has a distinct cell wall as its outer boundary and just within it is the cell membrane. The cells of the human cheek have an outer membrane as the delimiting structure of the cell. Inside each cell is a dense membrane bound structure called nucleus. This nucleus contains the chromosomes which in turn contain the genetic material, DNA. Cells that have membrane bound nuclei are called eukaryotic whereas cells that lack a membrane bound nucleus are prokaryotic. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, a semi-fluid matrix called cytoplasm occupies the volume of the cell. The cytoplasm is the main arena of cellular activities in both the plant and animal cells. Various chemical reactions occur in it to keep the cell in the ‘living state’.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">Besides the nucleus, the eukaryotic cells have other membrane bound distinct structures called</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">organelles</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the golgi complex, lysosomes, mitochondria, microbodies and vacuoles. The prokaryotic cells lack such membrane bound organelles.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Ribosomes are non-membrane bound organelles found in all cells &ndash; both eukaryotic as well as prokaryotic. Within the cell, ribosomes are found not only in the cytoplasm but also within the two organelles &ndash; chloroplasts (in plants) and mitochondria and on rough ER.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Animal cells contain another non-membrane bound organelle called centriole which helps in cell division.</p>

    <p class="calibre4"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">Cells differ greatly in size, shape and activities (Figure 8.1). For example, Mycoplasmas, the smallest cells, are only 0.3</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">µ</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">m in length while bacteria could be 3 to 5</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">µ</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">m. The largest isolated single cell is the egg of an ostrich. Among multicellular organisms, human red blood cells are about 7.0</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">µ</span><span class="char-style-override1">m in diameter. Nerve cells are some of the longest cells. Cells also vary greatly in their shape. They may be disc-like, polygonal, columnar, cuboid, thread like, or even irregular. The shape of the cell may vary with the function they perform.</span></p>

    <p class="conceptheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override3">8.4 Prokaryotic Cells</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">The prokaryotic cells are represented by bacteria, blue-green algae, mycoplasma and PPLO (Pleuro Pneumonia Like Organisms). They are generally smaller and multiply more rapidly than the eukaryotic cells (Figure 8.2). They may vary greatly in shape and size. The four basic shapes of bacteria are bacillus (rod like), coccus (spherical), vibrio (comma shaped) and spirillum (spiral).</p>

    <p class="calibre4"><span class="char-style-override1">The organisation of the prokaryotic cell is fundamentally similar even though prokaryotes exhibit a wide variety of shapes and functions. All prokaryotes have a cell wall surrounding the cell membrane except in mycoplasma. The fluid matrix filling the cell is the cytoplasm. There is no well-defined nucleus. The genetic material is basically naked, not enveloped by a nuclear membrane. In addition to the genomic DNA (the single chromosome/circular DNA), many bacteria have small circular DNA outside the genomic DNA. These smaller DNA are called plasmids. The plasmid DNA confers certain unique phenotypic characters to such bacteria. One such character is resistance to antibiotics. In higher classes you will learn that this plasmid DNA is used to monitor bacterial transformation with foreign DNA. Nuclear membrane is found in eukaryotes. No organelles, like the ones in eukaryotes, are found in prokaryotic cells except for ribosomes. Prokaryotes have something unique in the form of inclusions. A specialised differentiated form of cell membrane called mesosome is the characteristic of prokaryotes. They are essentially infoldings of cell membrane.</span></p>

    <p class="subheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override2">8.4.1 Cell Envelope and its Modifications</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">Most prokaryotic cells, particularly the bacterial cells, have a chemically complex cell envelope. The cell envelope consists of a tightly bound three layered structure i.e., the outermost glycocalyx followed by the cell wall and then the plasma membrane. Although each layer of the envelope performs distinct function</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">, they act together as a single protective unit. Bacteria can be classified into two groups on the basis of the differences in the cell envelopes and the manner in which they respond to the staining procedure developed by Gram viz., those that take up the gram stain are</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">Gram positive</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">and the others that do not are called</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">Gram negative</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">bacteria.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">Glycocalyx differs in composition and thickness among different bacteria. It could be a loose sheath called the</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">slime layer</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">in some, while in others it may be thick and tough, called the</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">capsule</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">. The</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">cell wall</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">determines the shape of the cell and provides a strong structural support to prevent the bacterium from bursting or collapsing.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">The plasma membrane is semi-permeable in nature and interacts with the outside world. This membrane is similar structurally to that of the eukaryotes.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">A special membranous structure is the</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">mesosome</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">which is formed by the extensions of plasma membrane into the cell. These extensions are in the</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">form of vesicles, tubules and lamellae</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">. They help in cell wall formation, DNA replication and distribution to daughter cells. They also help in respiration, secretion processes, to increase the surface area of the plasma membrane and enzymatic content. In some prokaryotes like cyanobacteria, there are other membranous extensions into the cytoplasm called chromatophores which contain pigments.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">Bacterial cells may be motile or non-motile. If motile, they have thin filamentous extensions from their cell wall called flagella. Bacteria show a range in the number and arrangement of flagella. Bacterial flagellum is composed of three parts &ndash;</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">filament, hook</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">and</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">basal body</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">. The filament is the longest portion and extends from the cell surface to the outside.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">Besides flagella, Pili and Fimbriae are also surface structures of the bacteria but do not play a role in motility. The</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">pili</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">are elongated tubular structures made of a special protein. The</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">fimbriae</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">are small bristle like fibres sprouting out of the cell. In some bacteria, they are known to help attach the bacteria to rocks in streams and also to the host tissues.</span></p>

    <p class="subheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override2">8.4.2 Ribosomes and Inclusion Bodies</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">In prokaryotes, ribosomes are associated with the plasma membrane of the cell. They are about 15 nm by 20 nm in size and are made of two subunits - 50S and 30S units which when present together form 70S prokaryotic ribosomes. Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. Several ribosomes may attach to a single mRNA and form a chain called</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">polyribosomes</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">or</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">polysome</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">. The ribosomes of a polysome translate the mRNA into proteins.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">Inclusion bodies:</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">Reserve material in prokaryotic cells are stored in the cytoplasm in the form of inclusion bodies. These are not bound by any membrane system and lie free in the cytoplasm, e.g., phosphate granules, cyanophycean granules and glycogen granules. Gas vacuoles are found in blue green and purple and green photosynthetic bacteria.</span></p>

    <p class="conceptheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override3">8.5 Eukaryotic Cells</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">The eukaryotes include all the protists, plants, animals and fungi. In eukaryotic cells there is an extensive compartmentalisation of cytoplasm through the presence of membrane bound organelles. Eukaryotic cells possess an organised nucleus with a nuclear envelope. In addition, eukaryotic cells have a variety of complex locomotory and cytoskeletal structures. Their genetic material is organised into chromosomes.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">All eukaryotic cells are not identical. Plant and animal cells are different as the former possess cell walls, plastids and a large central vacuole which are absent in animal cells. On the other hand, animal cells have centrioles which are absent in almost all plant cells (Figure 8.3).</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">Let us now look at individual cell organelles to understand their structure and functions.</span></p>

    <p class="subheading" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override2">8.5.1 Cell Membrane</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4">The detailed structure of the membrane was studied only after the advent of the electron microscope in the 1950s. Meanwhile, chemical studies on the cell membrane, especially in human red blood cells (RBCs), enabled the scientists to deduce the possible structure of plasma membrane.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">These studies showed that the cell membrane is composed of lipids that are arranged in a bilayer. Also, the lipids are arranged within the membrane with the polar head towards the outer sides and the hydrophobic tails towards the inner part.This ensures that the nonpolar tail of saturated hydrocarbons is protected from the aqueous environment (Figure 8.4). The lipid component of the membrane mainly consists of phosphoglycerides.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">Later, biochemical investigation clearly revealed that the cell membranes also possess protein and carbohydrate.

    <p class="calibre4">Depending on the ease of extraction, membrane proteins can be classified as integral or peripheral. Peripheral proteins lie on the surface of membrane while the integral proteins are partially or totally buried in the membrane.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">An improved model of the structure of cell membrane was proposed by Singer and Nicolson (1972) widely accepted as</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">fluid mosaic model</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">(Figure 8.4). According to this, the quasi-fluid nature of lipid enables lateral movement of proteins within the overall bilayer. This ability to move within the membrane is measured as its fluidity.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">The fluid nature of the membrane is also important from the point of view of functions like cell growth, formation of intercellular junctions, secretion, endocytosis, cell division etc.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">One of the most important functions of the plasma membrane is the transport of the molecules across it. The membrane is selectively permeable to some molecules present on either side of it. Many molecules can move briefly across the membrane without any requirement of energy and this is called the</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">passive transport</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">. Neutral solutes may move across the membrane by the process of simple diffusion along the concentration gradient, i.e., from higher concentration to the lower. Water may also move across this membrane from higher to lower concentration. Movement of water by diffusion is called</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">osmosis</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">. As the polar molecules cannot pass through the nonpolar lipid bilayer, they require a carrier protein of the membrane to facilitate their transport across the membrane. A few ions or molecules are transported across the membrane against their concentration gradient, i.e., from lower to the higher concentration. Such a transport is an energy dependent process, in which ATP is utilised and is called</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">active transport</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">, e.g., Na</span><span class="calibre11" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre14">+</sup></span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">/K</span><span class="calibre11" lang="en-GB"><sup class="calibre14">+</sup></span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">Pump.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">As you may recall, a non-living rigid structure called the cell wall forms an outer covering for the plasma membrane of fungi and plants. Cell wall not only gives shape to the cell and protects the cell from mechanical damage and infection, it also helps in cell-to-cell interaction and provides barrier to undesirable macromolecules. Algae have cell wall, made of cellulose, galactans, mannans and minerals like calcium carbonate, while in other plants it consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins and proteins. The cell wall of a young plant cell, the</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">primary wall</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">is capable of growth, which gradually diminishes as the cell matures and the secondary wall is formed on the inner (towards membrane) side of the cell.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">The middle lamella is a layer mainly of calcium pectate which holds or glues the different neighbouring cells together.

    <p class="calibre4"><span class="char-style-override1">While each of the membranous organelles is distinct in terms of its structure and function, many of these are considered together as an endomembrane system because their functions are coordinated. The endomembrane system include endoplasmic reticulum (ER), golgi complex, lysosomes and vacuoles. Since the functions of the mitochondria, chloroplast and peroxisomes are not coordinated with the above components, these are not considered as part of the endomembrane system.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">Electron microscopic studies of eukaryotic cells reveal the presence of a network or reticulum of tiny tubular structures scattered in the cytoplasm that is called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Figure 8.5). Hence, ER divides the intracellular space into two distinct compartments, i.e., luminal (inside ER) and extra luminal (cytoplasm) compartments.</p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">The ER often shows ribosomes attached to their outer surface. The endoplasmic reticulun bearing ribosomes on their surface is called rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER).

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">RER is frequently observed in the cells actively involved in protein synthesis and secretion. They are extensive and continuous with the outer membrane of the nucleus.</p>

The nucleoli are spherical structures present in the nucleoplasm. The content of nucleolus is continuous with the rest of the nucleoplasm as it is not a membrane bound structure. It is a site for active ribosomal RNA synthesis. Larger and more numerous nucleoli are present in cells actively carrying out protein synthesis.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">You may recall that the interphase nucleus has a loose and indistinct network of nucleoprotein fibres called chromatin. But during different stages of cell division, cells show structured</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">chromosomes</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">in place of the nucleus. Chromatin contains DNA and some basic proteins called</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">histones</span><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">, some non-histone proteins and also RNA. A single human cell has approximately two metre long thread of DNA distributed among its forty six (twenty three pairs) chromosomes. You will study the details of DNA packaging in the form of a chromosome in class XII.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4"><span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">Every chromosome essentially has a primary constriction or the</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">centromere</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">on the sides of which disc shaped structures called</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">kinetochores</span> <span lang="en-GB" class="char-style-override1">are present (Figure 8.11).

      <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">All organisms are made of cells or aggregates of cells. Cells vary in their shape, size and activities/functions. Based on the presence or absence of a membrane bound nucleus and other organelles, cells and hence organisms can be named as eukaryotic or prokaryotic.</p>

      <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US">A typical eukaryotic cell consists of a cell membrane, nucleus and cytoplasm. Plant cells have a cell wall outside the cell membrane. The plasma membrane is selectively permeable and facilitates transport of several molecules. The endomembrane system includes ER, golgi complex, lysosomes and vacuoles. All the cell organelles perform different but specific functions. Centrosome and centriole form the basal body of cilia and flagella that facilitate locomotion. In animal cells, centrioles also form spindle apparatus during cell division. Nucleus contains nucleoli and chromatin network. It not only controls the activities of organelles but also plays a major role in heredity.</p>

      <p class="calibre4" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">Endoplasmic reticulum contains tubules or cisternae. They are of two types: rough and smooth. ER helps in the transport of substances, synthesis of proteins, lipoproteins and glycogen. The</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">golgi body is a membranous organelle composed of flattened sacs. The secretions of cells are packed in them and transported from the cell. Lysosomes are single membrane structures containing enzymes for digestion of all types of macromolecules. Ribosomes are involved in protein synthesis. These occur freely in the cytoplasm or are associated with ER. Mitochondria help in oxidative phosphorylation and generation of adenosine triphosphate. They are bound by double membrane; the outer membrane is smooth and inner one folds into several cristae. Plastids are pigment containing organelles found in plant cell</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">s</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">only. In plant cells, chloroplasts are responsible for trapping light energy essential for photosynthesis. The grana, in the plastid, is the site of light reactions and the stroma of dark reactions. The green coloured plastids are chloroplasts, which contain chlorophyll, whereas the other coloured plastids are chromoplasts, which may contain pigments like carotene and xanthophyll. The nucleus is enclosed by nuclear envelop</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-GB">e, a double membrane structure with nuclear pores. The inner membrane encloses the nucleoplasm and the chromatin material. Thus, cell is the structural and functional unit of life.</span></p>
