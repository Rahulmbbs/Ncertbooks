Environmental studies deal with the sum of all social, economical, biological, physical and chemical interrelations with our surroundings. In this unit the focus will be on environmental chemistry. Environmental chemistry deals with the study of the origin, transport, reactions, effects and fates of chemical species in the environment. Let us discuss some important aspects of environmental chemistry.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">Environmental pollution is the effect of undesirable changes in our surroundings that have harmful effects on plants, animals and human beings. A substance, which causes pollution, is known as pollutant. Pollutants can be solid, liquid or gaseous substances present in greater concentration than in natural abundance and are produced due to human activities or due to natural happenings. Do you know, an average human being requires nearly 12-15 times more air than the food. So, even small amounts of pollutants in the air become significant compared to similar levels present in the food. Pollutants can be degradable, like discarded vegetables which rapidly break down by natural processes. On the other hand, pollutants which are slowly degradable, remain in the environment in an unchanged form for many decades. For example, substances such as dichlorodi-phenyltrichloroethane (DDT), plastic materials, heavy metals, many chemicals, nuclear wastes etc., once released into the environment are difficult to remove. These pollutants cannot be degraded by natural processes and are harmful to living organisms. In the process of environmental pollution, pollutants originate from a source and get transported by air or water or are dumped into the soil by human beings.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">The atmosphere that surrounds the earth is not of the same thickness at all heights. There are concentric layers of air or regions and each layer has different density. The lowest region of atmosphere in which the human beings along with other organisms live is called</span> <span class="calibre10">troposphere</span><span class="calibre11">. It extends up to the height of ~ 10 km from sea level. Above the troposphere, between 10 and 50 km above sea level lies</span> <span class="calibre10">stratosphere</span><span class="calibre11">. Troposphere is a turbulent, dusty zone containing air, much water vapour and clouds. This is the region of strong air movement and cloud formation. The stratosphere, on the other hand, contains dinitrogen, dioxygen, ozone and little water vapour.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">Atmospheric pollution is generally studied as tropospheric and stratospheric pollution. The presence of ozone in the stratosphere prevents about 99.5 per cent of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiations from reaching the earth’s surface and thereby protecting humans and other animals from its effect.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">Tropospheric pollution occurs due to the presence of undesirable solid or gaseous particles in the air. The following are the major gaseous and particulate pollutants present in the troposphere:</span></p>

Sulphur dioxide causes irritation to the eyes, resulting in tears and redness. High concentration of SO</span><sub class="calibre12">2</sub> <span class="calibre11">leads to stiffness of flower buds which eventually fall off from plants.

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override2"><b class="calibre10">(i) Carbon monoxide:</b></span> <span class="calibre11">Carbon monoxide (CO) is one of the most serious air pollutants. It is a colourless and odourless gas, highly poisonous to living beings because of its ability to block the delivery of oxygen to the organs and tissues. It is produced as a result of incomplete combustion of carbon. Carbon monoxide is mainly released into the air by automobile exhaust. Other sources, which produce CO, involve incomplete combustion of coal, firewood, petrol, etc. The number of vehicles has been increasing over the years all over the world. Many vehicles are poorly maintained and several have inadequate pollution control equipments resulting in the release of greater amount of carbon monoxide and other polluting gases. Do you know why carbon monoxide is poisonous? It binds to haemoglobin to form carboxyhaemoglobin, which is about 300 times more stable than the oxygen-haemoglobin complex. In blood, when the concentration of carboxyhaemoglobin reaches about 3&ndash;4 per cent, the oxygen carrying capacity of blood is greatly reduced. This oxygen deficiency, results into headache, weak eyesight, nervousness and cardiovascular disorder. This is the reason why people are advised not to smoke. In pregnant women who have the habit of smoking the increased CO level in blood may induce premature birth, spontaneous abortions and deformed babies.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override2"><b class="calibre10">(ii) Carbon dioxide:</b></span> <span class="calibre11">Carbon dioxide (CO</span><sub class="calibre12">2</sub><span class="calibre11">) is released into the atmosphere by respiration, burning of fossil fuels for energy, and by decomposition of limestone during the manufacture of cement. It is also emitted during volcanic eruptions. Carbon dioxide gas is confined to troposphere only. Normally it forms about 0.03 per cent by volume of the atmosphere. With the increas</span><span class="calibre11">ed use of fo</span><span class="calibre11">s</span><span class="calibre11">sil fuels, a large amount of carbon dioxide gets released into the atmosphere. Excess of CO</span><sub class="calibre12">2</sub> <span class="calibre11">in the air is removed by green plants and this maintains an appropriate level of CO</span><sub class="calibre12">2</sub> <span class="calibre11">in the atmosphere. Green plants require CO</span><sub class="calibre12">2</sub> <span class="calibre11">for photosynthesis and they, in turn, emit oxygen, thus maintaining the delicate balance. As you know, deforestation and burning of fossil fuel increases the CO</span><sub class="calibre12">2</sub> <span class="calibre11">level and disturb the balance in the atmosphere. The increased amount of CO</span><sub class="calibre12">2</sub> <span class="calibre11">in the air is mainly responsible for global warming.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11"><b class="calibre10"><i class="calibre9">Global Warming and Greenhouse Effect</i></b></span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">About 75 % of the solar energy reaching the earth is absorbed by the earth’s surface, which increases its temperature. The rest of the heat radiates back to the atmosphere. Some of the heat is trapped by gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, chlorofluorocarbon compounds (CFCs) and water vapour in the atmosphere. Thus, they add to the heating of the atmosphere. This causes global warming.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">We all know that in cold places flowers, vegetables and fruits are grown in glass covered areas called greenhouse. Do you know that we humans also live in a greenhouse? Of course, we are not surrounded by glass but a blanket of air called the atmosphere, which has kept the temperature on earth constant for centuries. But it is now undergoing change, though slowly. Just as the glass in a greenhouse holds the sun’s warmth inside, atmosphere traps the sun’s heat near the earth’s surface and keeps it warm. This is called</span> <span class="calibre9">natural greenhouse effect</span> <span class="calibre11">because it maintains the temperature and makes the earth perfect for life. In a greenhouse, solar radiations pass through the transparent glass and heat up the soil and the plants. The warm soil and plants emit infrared radiations. Since glass is opaque to infrared radiations (thermal region), it partly reflects and partly absorbs these radiations. This mechanism keeps the energy of the sun trapped in the greenhouse. Similarly, carbon dioxide molecules also trap heat as they are transparent to sunlight but not to the heat radiation. If the amount of carbon dioxide</span> <span class="calibre11">crosses the delicate proportion of 0.03 per cent, the natural greenhouse balance may get disturbed. Carbon dioxide is the major contributor to global warming.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">Besides carbon dioxide, other greenhouse gases are methane, water vapour, nitrous oxide, CFCs and ozone. Methane is produced naturally when vegetation is burnt, digested or rotted in the absence of oxygen. Large amounts of methane are released in paddy fields, coal mines, from rotting garbage dumps and by fossil fuels. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are man-made industrial chemicals used in air conditioning etc. CFCs are also damaging the ozone layer (Section 14.2.2). Nitrous oxide occurs naturally in the environment. In recent years, their quantities have increased significantly due to the use of chemical fertilizers and the burning of fossil fuels. If these trends continue, the average global temperature will increase to a level which may lead to melting of polar ice caps and flooding of low lying areas all over the earth. </span><span class="calibre11">Increase in the global temperature increases the incidence of infectious diseases like dengue, malaria</span>, yellow fever, sleeping sickness etc.</p><p class="normal"><br class="basic-graphics-frame" /></p>

We should plant more trees to increase the green cover. Avoid burning of dry leaves, wood etc. It is illegal to smoke in public places and work places, because it is harmful not only for the one who is smoking but also for others, and therefore, we should avoid it.

    <p class="normal">Acid rain refers to the ways in which acid from the atmosphere is deposited on the earth’s surface. Oxides of nitrogen and sulphur which are acidic in nature can be blown by wind along with solid particles in the atmosphere and finally settle down either on the ground as dry deposition or in water, fog and snow as wet deposition. (Fig. 14.1)</p>

    <p class="normal">Acid rain is a byproduct of a variety of human activities that emit the oxides of sulphur and nitrogen in the atmosphere. As mentioned earlier, burning of fossil fuels (which contain sulphur and nitrogenous matter) such as coal and oil in power stations and furnaces or petrol and diesel in motor engines produce sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. SO<span class="char-style-override7">2</span> and NO<span class="char-style-override7">2</span> after oxidation and reaction with water are major contributors to acid rain, because polluted air usually contains particulate matter that catalyse the oxidation.</p>

      <p class="normal1">This can be done by reducing the emission of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. We should use less vehicles driven by fossil fuels; use less sulphur content fossil fuels for power plants and industries. We should use natural gas which is a better fuel than coal or use coal with less sulphur content. Catalytic converters must be used in cars to reduce the effect of exhaust fumes on the atmosphere. The main component of the converter is a ceramic honeycomb coated with precious metals &mdash; Pd, Pt and Rh.

A new natural gas pipeline would bring more than half a million cubic metres of natural gas a day to this area. People living in the city will also be encouraged to use liquefied petroleum gas in place of coal, kerosene or firewood. Vehicles plying on highways in the vicinity of Taj would be encouraged to use low sulphur content diesel.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">Particulates pollutants are</span> <span class="calibre11">the minute solid particles or liquid droplets in air. These are present in vehicle emissions, smoke particles from fires, dust particles and ash from industries. Particulates in the atmosphere may be viable or non-viable. The viable particulates</span> <span class="calibre9">e.g.,</span> <span class="calibre11">bacteria, fungi, moulds, algae etc., are minute living organisms that are dispersed in the atmosphere. Human beings are allergic to some of the fungi found in air. They can also cause plant diseases.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">Non-viable particulates may be classified according to their nature and size as follows:</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">(a) Smoke particulates consist of solid or mixture of solid and liquid particles formed during combustion of organic matter. Examples are cigarette smoke, smoke from burning of fossil fuel, garbage and dry leaves, oil smoke etc.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">(b) Dust is composed of fine solid particles (over 1</span><span class="calibre11">µ</span><span class="calibre11">m in diameter), produced during crushing, grinding and attribution of solid materials. Sand from sand blasting, saw dust from wood works, pulverized coal, cement and fly ash from factories, dust storms etc., are some typical examples of this type of particulate emission.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">(c) Mists are produced by particles of spray liquids and by condensation of vapours in air. Example</span><span class="calibre11">s are sulphuric acid mist and herbicides and insecticides that miss their targets and travel through air and form mists.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">(d) Fumes are generally obtained by the condensation of vapours during sublimation, distillation, boiling and several other chemical reactions. Generally, organic solvents, metals and metallic oxides form fume particles.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">The effect of particulate pollutants are largely dependent on the particle size. Air- borne particles such as dust, fumes, mist etc., are dangerous for human health. Particulate pollutants bigger than 5 microns are likely to lodge in the nasal passage, whereas particles of about 10 micron enter into lungs easily.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">Lead used to be a major air pollutant emitted by vehicles. Leaded petrol used to be the primary source of air-borne lead emission in Indian cities.

Pathogens include bacteria and other organisms that enter water from domestic sewage and animal excreta. Human excreta contain bacteria such as</span> <span class="calibre9">Escherichia coli</span> <span class="calibre11">and</span><span class="calibre9">Streptococcus faecalis</span> <span class="calibre11">which cause gastrointestinal diseases.</span></p><p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override2">(ii) Organic wastes:</span> <span class="calibre11">The other major water pollutant is organic matter such as leaves, grass, trash etc. They pollute water as a consequence of run off. Excessive phytoplankton growth within water is also a cause of water pollution. These wastes are biodegradable.</span></p></p><p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">The large population of bacteria decomposes organic matter present in water. They consume oxygen dissolved in water. The amount</span> <span class="calibre11">of oxygen that water can hold in the solution is limited. In cold water, dissolved oxygen (DO) can reach a concentration up to 10 ppm (parts per million), whereas oxygen in air is about 200,000 ppm. That is why even a moderate amount of organic matter when decomposes in water can deplete the water of its dissolved oxygen. The concentration of dissolved oxygen</span> <span class="calibre11">in</span> <span class="calibre11">water is very important for aquatic life . If the concentration of dissolved oxygen of water is below 6 ppm, the growth of fish gets inhibited. Oxygen reaches water either through atmosphere or from the process of photosynthesis carried out by many aquatic green plants during day light. However, during night, photosynthesis stops but the plants continue to respire, resulting in reduction of dissolved oxygen. The dissolved oxygen is also used by microorganisms to oxidise organic matter.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">If too much of organic matter is added to water, all the available oxygen is used up. This causes oxygen dependent aquatic life to die. Thus, anaerobic bacteria (which do not require oxygen) begin to break down the organic waste and produce chemicals that have a foul smell and are harmful to human health. Aerobic (oxygen requiring) bacteria degrade these organic wastes and keep the water depleted in dissolved oxygen.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">Thus, the amount of oxygen required by bacteria to break down the organic matter present in a certain volume of a sample of water, is called</span> <span class="calibre10">Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)</span><span class="calibre11">. The amount of BOD in the water is a measure of the amount of organic material in the water, in terms of how much oxygen will be required to break it down biologically. Clean water would have BOD value of less than 5 ppm whereas highly polluted water could have a BOD value of 17 ppm or more.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override2"><b class="calibre10">(iii) Chemical Pollutants:</b></span> <span class="calibre11">As we know that water is an excellent solvent, water soluble inorganic chemicals that include heavy metals such as cadmium, mercury, nickel etc constitute an important class of pollutants. All these metals are dangerous to humans because our body cannot excrete them. Over the time, it crosses the tolerance limit. These metals then can damage kidneys, central nervous system, liver etc. Acids (like sulphuric acid) from mine drainage and salts from many different sources including raw salt used to melt snow and ice in the colder climates (sodium and calcium chloride) are water soluble chemical poll</span><span class="calibre11">utants.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">The organic chemica</span><span class="calibre11">ls are another group of substances that are found in polluted water. Petroleu</span><span class="calibre11">m products pollute many sources of water e.g., major oil spills in oceans. Other organic substances with serious impacts are the pesticides that drift down from sprays or runoff from lands. Various industrial chemicals like polychlorinated biphenyls, (PCBs) which are used as cleansing solvent, detergents and fertilizers add to the list of water pollutants. PCBs are suspected to be carcinogenic. Nowadays most of the detergents available are biodegradable. However, their use can create other problems. The bacteria responsible for degrading biodegradable detergent feed on it and grow rapidly. While growing, they may use up all the oxygen dissolved in water. The lack of oxygen kills all other forms of aquatic life such as fish and plants. Fertilizers contain phosphates as additives. The addition of phosphates in water enhances algae growth. Such profuse growth of algae, covers the water surface and reduces the oxygen concentration in water. This leads to anaerobic conditions, commonly with accumulation of abnoxious decay and animal death. Thus, bloom-infested water inhibits the growth of other living organisms in the water body. This process in which nutrient enriched water bodies support a dense plant population, which kills animal life by depriving it of oxygen and results in subsequent loss of biodiversity is known as</span> <span class="char-style-override2">Eutrophication</span><span class="calibre9">.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">India being an agriculture based economy gives high priority to agriculture, fisheries and livestock development. The surplus production is stored by governmental and non-governmental organisations for the lean season. The food loss during the storage also needs special attention. Have you ever seen the damages caused to the crops, food items by insects, rodents, weeds and crop diseases etc? How can we protect them? You are acquainted with some insecticides and pesticides for protection of our crops. However, these insecticides, pesticides and herbicides cause soil pollution. Hence, there is a need for their judicious use.</span></p>

    <p class="subheading"><span class="char-style-override4"><br class="basic-graphics-frame" /></span></p><p class="subheading"><span class="char-style-override4">14.4.1 Pesticides</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">Prior to World War II, many naturally occurring chemicals such as nicotine (by planting tobacco plants in the crop field), were used as pest controlling substance for major crops in agricultural practices.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">During World War II, DDT was found to be of great use in the control of malaria and other insect-borne diseases. Therefore, after the war, DDT was put to use in agriculture to control the damages caused by insects, rodents, weeds and various crop diseases. However, due to adverse effects, its use has been banned in India.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">Pesticides are basically synthetic toxic chemicals with ecological repercussions. The repeated use of the same or similar pesticides give rise to pests that are resistant to that group of pesticides thus making the pesticides ineffective. Therefore, as insect resistance of DDT increased, other organic toxins such as Aldrin and Dieldrin were introduced in the market by pesticide industry. Most of the organic toxins are water insoluble and non-biodegradable.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">These high persistent toxins are, therefore, transferred from lower trophic level to higher trophic level through food chain (Fig.14.3). Over the time, the concentration of toxins in higher animals reach a level which causes serious metabolic and physiological disorders.<br class="basic-graphics-frame" /></span></p><p class="normal"><span class="calibre11"><br class="basic-graphics-frame" /></span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">In response to high persistence of chlorinated organic toxins, a new series of less persistent or more bio-degradable products called organo-phosphates and carbamates have been introduced in the market. But these chemicals are severe nerve toxins and hence more harmful to humans. As a result, there are reports of some pesticides related deaths of agricultural field workers. Insects have become resistant to these insecticides also. The insecticide industry is engaged in developing new groups of insecticides. But one has to think, is this the only solution to pest menace?</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">These days, the pesticide industry has shifted its attention to</span> <span class="calibre10">herbicides</span> <span class="calibre11">such as sodium chlorate (NaClO</span><sub class="calibre12">3</sub><span class="calibre11">), sodium arsinite (Na</span><sub class="calibre12">3</sub><span class="calibre11">AsO</span><sub class="calibre12">3</sub><span class="calibre11">) and many others.

But one must remember that these are also not environment friendly.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">Most herbicides are toxic to mammals but are not as persistent as organo-chlorides. These chemicals decompose in a few months. Like organo-chlorides, these too become concentrated in the food web. Some herbicides cause birth defects.

Besides</span> <span class="calibre11">household discar</span><span class="calibre11">ds, there are medical, agricultural, industrial and mining wastes.

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">Domestic wastes are collected in small bins, which are then transferred to community bins by private or municipal workers. From these community bins, these are collected and carried to the disposable site. At the site, garbage is sorted out and separated into biodegradable and non-biodegradable materials. Non-biodegradable materials such as plastic, glass, metal scraps etc. are sent for recycling. Biodegradable wastes are deposited in land fills and are converted into compost.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">The waste if not collected in garbage bins, finds its way into the sewers. Some of it is eaten by cattle.

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">As a normal practice, therefore, all domestic wastes should be properly collected and disposed. The poor management causes health problems leading to epidemics due to contamination of ground water.

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">The solution of this problem does not lie in stopping the process of development that has been set in; but to discover methods, which would help in the reduction of deterioration of the environment.</span> <span class="calibre9">Green chemistry is a way of thinking and is about utilising the existing knowledge and principles of chemistry and other sciences to reduce the adverse impact on environment. Green chemistry is a production process that would bring about minimum pollution or deterioration to the environment. The byproducts generated during a process, if not used gainfully, add to the environmental pollution. Such processes are not only environmental unfriendly but also cost-ineffective. The waste generation and its disposal both are economically unsound. Utilisation of existing knowledge base for reducing the chemical hazards along with the developmental activities is the foundation of green chemistry.</span> <span class="calibre11">Have you perceived the idea of green chemistry ?

    <p class="normal"><span class="calibre11">As you know, a chemical reaction involves reactants, attacking reagents and the medium in which the reaction takes place. Extent of any reaction depends upon physical parameters like temperature, pressure and use of catalyst.

Chemical species present in the environment are either naturally occurring or generated by human activities.</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-US">Environmental pollution</span> <span class="calibre11" lang="en-US">is the effect of undesirable changes in the surrounding that have harmful effects on plants, animals and human beings. Pollutants exist in all the three states of matter. We have discussed only those pollutants, which are due to human activities, and can be controlled. Atmospheric pollution is generally studied as</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-US">tropospheric</span> <span class="calibre11" lang="en-US">and</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-US">stratospheric pollution</span><span class="calibre11" lang="en-US">. Troposphere is the lowest region of the atmosphere (~10 km) in which man along with other organisms including plants exist. Whereas stratosphere extends above troposphere up to 50 km above sea level. Ozone layer is one of the important constituents of stratosphere. Tropospheric pollution is basically due to various oxides of sulphur, nitrogen, carbon, halogens and also due to particulate pollutants. The gaseous pollutants come down to the earth in the form of</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-US">acid rain</span><span class="calibre11" lang="en-US">. 75% of the solar energy reaching earth is absorbed by the earth surface and rest is radiated back to the atmosphere. These gases mentioned above trap the heat which result into</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-US">global warming</span><span class="calibre11" lang="en-US">. It is important to realise that these very gases are also responsible for the life on the earth as they trap the requisite amount of solar energy for the sustainance of life. The increase in the</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-US">greenhouse gases</span> <span class="calibre11" lang="en-US">is raising the temperature of the earth’s atmosphere which, if not checked, may eventually result in melting of polar ice caps and consequently may submerge the costal land mass. Many human activities are producing chemicals, which are responsible for the</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-US">depletion of ozone layer</span> <span class="calibre11" lang="en-US">in the stratosphere, leading to the formation of</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-US">ozone hole</span><span class="calibre11" lang="en-US">. Through the ozone hole, ultraviolet radiations can penetrate into the earth’s atmosphere causing mutation of genes. Water is the elixir of life but the same water, if polluted by pathogens, organic wastes, toxic heavy metals, pesticides etc., will turn into poison. Therefore, one should take care to follow international standards to maintain purity levels of drinking water. Industrial wastes and excessive use of pesticides, result into pollution of land mass and water bodies. Judicious use of chemicals required for agricultural practices can lead to sustainable development.</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-US">Strategies for controlling environmental pollution</span> <span class="calibre11" lang="en-US">can be: (i) waste management</span> <span class="char-style-override7" lang="en-US">i.e.,</span> <span class="calibre11" lang="en-US">reduction of the waste and proper disposal, also recycling of materials and energy, (ii) adopting methods in day-to-day life, which results in the reduction of environmental pollution. The second method is a new branch of chemistry, which is in its infancy known as</span> <span class="calibre10" lang="en-US">green chemistry</span><span class="calibre11">. It utilizes the existing knowledge and practices so as to bring about reduction in the production of pollutants.</span></p>
