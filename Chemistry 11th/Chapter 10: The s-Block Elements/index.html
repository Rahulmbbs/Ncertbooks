Group 1 of the Periodic Table consists of the elements: lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium and francium.

These are so called because they form hydroxides on reaction with water which are strongly alkaline in nature.

    <p class="normal">Lithium and beryllium, the first elements of Group 1 and Group 2 respectively exhibit some properties which are different from those of the other members of the respective group. In these anomalous properties they resemble the second element of the following group. Thus, lithium shows similarities to magnesium and beryllium to aluminium in many of their properties. This type of diagonal similarity is commonly referred to as <span class="calibre7">diagonal relationship</span> in the periodic table. The diagonal relationship is due to the similarity in ionic sizes and /or charge/radius ratio of the elements. Monovalent sodium and potassium ions and divalent magnesium and calcium ions are found in large proportions in biological fluids. These ions perform important biological functions such as maintenance of ion balance and nerve impulse conduction.</p>

    <p class="normal">The alkali metal atoms have the largest sizes in a particular period of the periodic table. With increase in atomic number, the atom becomes larger. The monovalent ions (M<sup class="calibre12">+</sup>) are smaller than the parent atom.

    <p class="normal">The ionization enthalpies of the alkali metals are considerably low and decrease down the group from Li to Cs. This is because the effect of increasing size outweighs the increasing nuclear charge, and the outermost electron is very well screened from the nuclear charge.</p>

However, potassium is lighter than sodium. The melting and boiling points of the alkali metals are low indicating weak metallic bonding due to the presence of only a single valence electron in them. The alkali metals and their salts impart characteristic colour to an oxidizing flame. This is because the heat from the flame excites the outermost orbital electron to a higher energy level. When the excited electron comes back to the ground state, there is emission of radiation in the visible region as given below:</p>

    <p class="normal">Sodium ions are found primarily on the outside of cells, being located in blood plasma and in the interstitial fluid which surrounds the cells. These ions participate in the transmission of nerve signals, in regulating the flow of water across cell membranes and in the transport of sugars and amino acids into cells. Sodium and potassium, although so similar chemically, differ quantitatively in their ability to penetrate cell membranes, in their transport mechanisms and in their efficiency to activate enzymes. Thus, potassium ions are the most abundant cations within cell fluids, where they activate many enzymes, participate in the oxidation of glucose to produce ATP and, with sodium, are responsible for the transmission of nerve signals.</p>

    <p class="normal">There is a very considerable variation in the concentration of sodium and potassium ions found on the opposite sides of cell membranes. As a typical example, in blood plasma, sodium is present to the extent of 143 mmolL<sup class="calibre12">&ndash;1</sup>, whereas the potassium level is only 5 mmolL<sup class="calibre12">&ndash;1</sup> within the red blood cells.

The melting and boiling points of these metals are higher than the corresponding alkali metals due to smaller sizes. The trend is, however, not systematic. Because of the low ionisation enthalpies, they are strongly electropositive in nature. The electropositive character increases down the group from Be to Ba. Calcium, strontium and barium impart characteristic brick red, crimson and apple green colours respectively to the flame. In flame the electrons are excited to higher energy levels and when they drop back to the ground state, energy is emitted in the form of visible light. The electrons in beryllium and magnesium are too strongly bound to get excited by flame. Hence, these elements do not impart any colour to the flame. The flame test for Ca, Sr and Ba is helpful in their detection in qualitative analysis and estimation by flame photometry. The alkaline earth metals like those of alkali metals have high electrical and thermal conductivities which are typical characteristics of metals.</p>

    <p class="normal">Beryllium is used in the manufacture of alloys. Copper-beryllium alloys are used in the preparation of high strength springs. Metallic beryllium is used for making windows of X-ray tubes. Magnesium forms alloys with aluminium, zinc, manganese and tin. Magnesium-aluminium alloys being light in mass are used in air-craft construction. Magnesium (powder and ribbon) is used in flash powders and bulbs, incendiary bombs and signals. A suspension of magnesium hydroxide in water (called <span class="calibre7">milk of magnesia</span>) is used as antacid in medicine. Magnesium carbonate is an ingredient of toothpaste. Calcium is used in the extraction of metals from oxides which are difficult to reduce with carbon. Calcium and barium metals, owing to their reactivity with oxygen and nitrogen at elevated temperatures, have often been used to remove air from vacuum tubes. Radium salts are used in radiotherapy, for example, in the treatment of cancer.</p>

    <p class="normal">The dipositive oxidation state (M<sup class="calibre12">2+</sup>) is the predominant valence of Group 2 elements. The alkaline earth metals form compounds which are predominantly ionic but less ionic than the corresponding compounds of alkali metals. This is due to increased nuclear charge and smaller size. The oxides and other compounds of beryllium and magnesium are more covalent than those formed by the heavier and large sized members (Ca, Sr, Ba). The general characteristics of some of the compounds of alkali earth metals are described below.</p>

The dehydration of hydrated chlorides, bromides and iodides of Ca, Sr and Ba can be achieved on heating; however, the corresponding hydrated halides of Be and Mg on heating suffer hydrolysis.

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override2"><b class="calibre11">(iii) Salts of Oxoacids:</b></span> The alkaline earth metals also form salts of oxoacids. Some of these are :</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override2"><b class="calibre11">Carbonates:</b></span> Carbonates of alkaline earth metals are insoluble in water and can be precipitated by addition of a sodium or ammonium carbonate solution to a solution of a soluble salt of these metals. The solubility of carbonates in water decreases as the atomic number of the metal ion increases. All the carbonates decompose on heating to give carbon dioxide and the oxide. Beryllium carbonate is unstable and can be kept only in the atmosphere of CO<sub class="calibre15">2</sub>. The thermal stability increases with increasing cationic size.</p>

    <p class="normal"><b class="calibre11"><span class="char-style-override2">Sulphates:</span></b> The sulphates of the alkaline earth metals are all white solids and stable to heat.

The greater hydration enthalpies of Be<sup class="calibre12">2+</sup> and Mg<sup class="calibre12">2+</sup> ions overcome the lattice enthalpy factor and therefore their sulphates are soluble in water.</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="char-style-override2"><b class="calibre11">Nitrates:</b></span> The nitrates are made by dissolution of the carbonates in dilute nitric acid. Magnesium nitrate crystallises with six molecules of water, whereas barium nitrate crystallises as the anhydrous salt.

It was first introduced in England in 1824 by Joseph Aspdin. It is also called Portland cement because it resembles with the natural limestone quarried in the Isle of Portland, England.</p>

    <p class="normal">Cement is a product obtained by combining a material rich in lime, CaO with other material such as clay which contains silica, SiO<sub class="calibre15">2</sub> along with the oxides of aluminium, iron and magnesium.

For a good quality cement, the ratio of silica (SiO<sub class="calibre15">2</sub>) to alumina (Al<sub class="calibre15">2</sub>O<sub class="calibre15">3</sub>) should be between 2.5 and 4 and the ratio of lime (CaO) to the total of the oxides of silicon (SiO<sub class="calibre15">2</sub>) aluminium (Al<sub class="calibre15">2</sub>O<sub class="calibre15">3</sub>) and iron (Fe<sub class="calibre15">2</sub>O<sub class="calibre15">3</sub>) should be as close as possible to 2.</p>

The alkali metals are characterised by one</span> <span class="char-style-override11">s</span><span class="calibre7">-electron and the alkaline earth metals by two</span> <span class="calibre7">s</span><span class="calibre7">-electrons in the valence shell of their atoms.

      <p class="normal"><span class="calibre7">There is a regular trend in the physical and chemical properties of the alkali metal with increasing atomic numbers. The</span> <span class="calibre11">atomic</span> <span class="calibre7">and</span> <span class="calibre11">ionic</span><span class="calibre7">sizes increase and the</span> <span class="calibre11">ionization enthalpies</span> <span class="calibre7">decrease systematically down the group. Somewhat similar trends are observed among the properties of the alkaline earth metals.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="calibre7">The first element in each of these groups, lithium in Group 1 and beryllium in Group 2 shows similarities in properties to the second member of the next group. Such similarities are termed as the</span><span class="calibre11">‘diagonal relationship’</span> <span class="calibre7">in the periodic table. As such these elements are anomalous as far as their group characteristics are concerned.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="calibre7">The alkali metals are silvery white, soft and low melting. They are highly reactive. The compounds of alkali metals are predominantly ionic. Their oxides and hydroxides are soluble in water forming strong alkalies. Important compounds of sodium includes sodium carbonate, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide and sodium hydrogencarbonate. Sodium hydroxide is manufactured by</span> <span class="calibre11">Castner-Kellner</span> <span class="calibre7">process and sodium carbonate by</span> <span class="calibre11">Solvay</span> <span class="calibre7">process.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="calibre7">The chemistry of alkaline earth metals is very much like that of the alkali metals. However, some differences arise because of reduced atomic and ionic sizes and increased cationic charges in case of alkaline earth metals. Their oxides and hydroxides are less basic than the alkali metal oxides and hydroxides. Industrially important compounds of calcium include calcium oxide (lime), calcium hydroxide (slaked lime), calcium sulphate</span> <span class="calibre11">(Plaster of Paris),</span> <span class="calibre7">calcium carbonate (limestone) and cement.</span> <span class="calibre11">Portland cement</span> <span class="calibre7">is an important constructional material. It is manufactured by heating a pulverised mixture of limestone and clay in a rotary kiln. The clinker thus obtained is mixed with some gypsum (2-3%) to give a fine powder of cement. All these substances find variety of uses in different areas.</span></p>
