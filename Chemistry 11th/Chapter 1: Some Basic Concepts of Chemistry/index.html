    <p class="conceptheading"><span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-US">1.1 IMPORTANCE OF CHEMISTRY</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><br class="calibre5" />
    Science can be viewed as a continuing human effort to systematize knowledge for describing and understanding nature. For the sake of convenience science is sub-divided into various disciplines: chemistry, physics, biology, geology etc. Chemistry is the branch of science that studies the composition, properties and interaction of matter. Chemists are interested in knowing how chemical transformations occur. Chemistry plays a central role in science and is often intertwined with other branches of science like physics, biology, geology etc. Chemistry also plays an important role in daily life.<br class="calibre5" /></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">Chemical principles are important in diverse areas, such as: weather patterns, functioning of brain and operation of a computer. Chemical industries manufacturing fertilizers, alkalis, acids, salts, dyes, polymers, drugs, soaps, detergents, metals, alloys and other inorganic and organic chemicals, including new materials, contribute in a big way to the national economy.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">Chemistry plays an important role in meeting human needs for food, health care products and other materials aimed at improving the quality of life. This is exemplified by the large scale production of a variety of fertilizers, improved varieties of pesticides and insecticides. Similarly many life saving drugs such as</span> <span class="calibre12" lang="en-US">cisplatin</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">and</span> <span class="calibre12" lang="en-US">taxol</span><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">, are effective in cancer therapy and AZT (Azidothymidine) used for helping AIDS victims, have been isolated from plant and animal sources or prepared by synthetic methods.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">With a better understanding of chemical principles it has now become possible to design and synthesize new materials having specific magnetic, electric and optical properties. This has lead to the production of superconducting ceramics, conducting polymers, optical fibres and large scale miniaturization of solid state devices. In recent years chemistry has tackled with a fair degree of success some of the pressing aspects of environmental degradation. Safer alternatives to environmentally hazardous refrigerants like CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), responsible for ozone depletion in the stratosphere, have been successfully synthesised. However, many big environmental problems continue to be matters of grave concern to the chemists. One such problem is the management of the Green House gases like methane, carbon dioxide etc. Understanding of bio-chemical processes, use of enzymes for large-scale production of chemicals and synthesis of new exotic materials are some of the intellectual challenges for the future generation of chemists. A developing country like India needs talented and creative chemists for accepting such challenges.</span></p>

    <p class="conceptheading">1.2 NATURE OF MATTER</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1"><br class="calibre5" />
    You are already familiar with the term</span> <span class="calibre12">matter</span> <span class="char-style-override1">from your earlier classes. Anything which has mass and occupies space is called</span> <span class="calibre12">matter</span><span class="char-style-override1">. Everything arou</span><span class="char-style-override1">nd us, for example, book, pen, pencil, water, air, all living beings etc. are composed of matter. You know that they have mass and they occupy space.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1">You are also aware that matter can exist in three physical states</span> <span class="calibre13">viz.</span> <span class="calibre12">solid</span><span class="char-style-override1">,</span> <span class="calibre12">liquid</span> <span class="char-style-override1">and</span> <span class="calibre12">gas</span><span class="char-style-override1">. The constituent particles of matter in these three states can be represented as shown in Fig. 1.1. In</span> <span class="calibre12">solids</span><span class="char-style-override1">, these particles are held very close to each other in an orderly fashion and there is not much freedom of movement. In</span> <span class="calibre12">liquids</span><span class="char-style-override1">, the particles are close to each other but they can move around. However, in</span> <span class="calibre12">gases</span><span class="char-style-override1">, the particles are far apart as compared to those present in solid or liquid states and their movement is easy and fast. Because of such arrangement of particles, different states of matter exhibit the following characteristics:</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1">(i) Solids have</span> <span class="calibre13">definite volume</span> <span class="char-style-override1">and</span> <span class="calibre13">definite shape</span><span class="char-style-override1">.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1">(ii) Liquids have</span> <span class="calibre13">definite volume</span> <span class="char-style-override1">but</span> <span class="calibre13">not</span> <span class="char-style-override1">the</span> <span class="calibre13">definite shape</span><span class="char-style-override1">. They take the shape of the container in which they are placed.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1">(iii) Gases have</span> <span class="calibre13">neither definite volume nor definite shape</span><span class="char-style-override1">. They completely occupy the container in w</span><span class="char-style-override1">hich they are placed.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">These three states of matter are interconvertible by changing the conditions of temperature and pressure.</p>

    <p class="calibre4">Solid <img alt="hc" src="images/000087.png" class="frame" /> liquid <img alt="hc" src="images/000087.png" class="frame" /> Gas</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">On heating a solid usually changes to a liquid and the liquid on further heating changes to the gaseous ( or vapour) state. In the reverse process, a gas on cooling liquifies to the liquid and the liquid on further cooling freezes to the solid.</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">At the macroscopic or bulk level, matter can be classified as<span class="calibre12">mixtures</span> or <span class="calibre12">pure substances</span>. These can be further sub-divided as shown in Fig. 1.2.<br class="calibre5" /></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">Many of the substances prese<span class="char-style-override1">nt around you are</span> <span class="calibre12">mixtures</span><span class="char-style-override1">. For example, sugar solution in water, air, tea etc., are all mixtures. A mixture contains two or more substances present in it (in any ratio) which are called its components. A mixture may be</span> <span class="calibre12">homogeneous</span> <span class="char-style-override1">or</span> <span class="calibre12">heterogeneous</span><span class="char-style-override1">. In a</span> <span class="calibre12">homogeneous mixture</span><span class="char-style-override1">, the components completely mix with each other and its composition is uniform throughout. Sugar solution, and air are thus, the examples of homogeneous mixtures. In contrast to this, in</span> <span class="calibre12">heterogeneous mixtures</span><span class="char-style-override1">, the composition is not uniform throughout and sometimes the different components can be observed. For example, the mixtures of salt and sugar, grains and pulses along with some dirt (often stone) pieces, are heterogeneous mixtures. You can think of many more examples of mixtures which you come across in the daily life. It is worthwhile to mention here that the components of a mixture can be separated by using physical methods such as simple hand picking, filtration, crystallisation, distillation etc.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1"><i class="calibre13">Pure substances</i></span> <span class="char-style-override1">have characteristics different from the mixtures. They have fixed composition, whereas mixtures may contain the components in any ratio and their composition is variable. Copper, silver, gold, water, glucose are some examples of pure substances. Glucose contains carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in a fixed ratio and thus, like all other pure substances has a fixed composition. Also, the constituents of pure substances cannot be separated by simple physical</span> methods.</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="calibre13">Pure substances</span> can be further classified into <span class="calibre12">elements</span> and <span class="calibre12">compounds</span>. An <span class="calibre12">element</span> consists of only one type of particles. These particles may be <span class="calibre12">atoms</span> or <span class="calibre12">molecules</span>. You may be familiar with atoms and molecules from the previous classes; however, you will be studying about them in detail in Unit 2. Sodium, copper, silver, hydrogen, oxygen etc. are some examples of elements. They all contain atoms of one type. However, the atoms of different elements are different in nature. Some elements such as sodium or copper, contain single atoms held together as their constituent particles whereas in some others, two or more atoms combine to give <span class="calibre12">molecules</span> of the element. Thus, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen gases consist of molecules in which two atoms combine to give their respective molecules. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.3.</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">You have see<span class="char-style-override1">n above that a water molecule comprises two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Similarly, a molecule of carbon dioxide contains two oxygen atoms combined with one carbon atom. Thus, the atoms of different elements are present in a compound in a fixed and definite ratio and this ratio is characteristic of a particular compound. Also, the properties of a compound are different from those of its constituent elements. For example, hydrogen and oxygen are gases whereas the compound formed by their combination</span> <span class="calibre13">i.e.,</span> <span class="char-style-override1">water is a liquid. It is interesting to note that hydrogen burns with a pop sound and oxygen is a supporter of combustion, but water is used as a fire extinguisher.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">Moreover, the constituents of a compound cannot be separated into simpler substances by physical methods. They can be separated by chemical methods.</p>

    <p class="conceptheading1"><span class="char-style-override2" lang="en-US">1.3 Properties of Matter and their Measurement</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1"><br class="calibre5" />
    Every substance has unique or characteristic properties. These properties can be classified into two categories &ndash;</span> <span class="calibre12">physical properties</span> <span class="char-style-override1">and</span> <span class="calibre12">chemical properties</span><span class="char-style-override1">.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="calibre12">Physical properties</span> <span class="char-style-override1">are those properties which can be measured or observed without changing the identity or the composition of the substance. Some examples of physical properties are colour, odour, melting point, boiling point, density etc. The measurement or observation of</span> <span class="calibre12">chemical properties</span> <span class="char-style-override1">require a chemical change to occur. The examples of chemic</span><span class="char-style-override1">al properties are characteristic reactions of different substances; these include acidity or basicity, combustibility etc.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1">Many properties of matter such as length, area, volume, etc., are quantitative in nature. Any quantitative observation or measurement is represented by a number followed by units in which it is measured. For example length of a room can be represented as 6 m; here 6 is the number and m denotes</span> <span class="calibre13">metre</span> <span class="char-style-override1">&ndash; the unit in which the length is measured.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1">Two different systems of measurement, i.e. the</span> <span class="calibre12">English System</span> <span class="char-style-override1">and the</span> <span class="calibre12">Metric System</span> <span class="char-style-override1">were being used in different parts of the world. The metric system which originated in France in late eighteenth century, was more convenient as it was based on the decimal system. The need of a common standard system was being felt by the scientific community. Such a system was established in 1960 and is discussed below in detail.</span></p>

    <p class="subheading"><span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-US">1.3.1 The International System of Units (SI)</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1"><br class="calibre5" />
    The International System of Units (in French</span> <span class="calibre13">Le Systeme International d’Unités</span> <span class="char-style-override1">&ndash; abbreviated as SI) was established by the 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM from</span> <span class="calibre13">Conference Generale des Poids et Measures</span><span class="char-style-override1">). The CGPM is an inter governmental treaty organization created by a diplomatic treaty known as Metre Convention which was signed in Paris in 1875.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1">The SI system has seven</span> <span class="calibre13">base units</span> <span class="char-style-override1">and they are listed in Table 1.1. These units pertain to the seven fundamental scientific quantities. The other physical quantities such as speed, volume, density etc. can be derived from these quantities.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">The definitions of the SI base units are given in Table 1.2.</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">The SI system allows the use of prefixes to indicate the multiples or submultiples of a unit. These prefixes are listed in Table 1. 3.</p>

      <p class="calibre4"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US"><b class="calibre12">Reference Standard</b></span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">After</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">defining a unit of measurement such as the kilogram or the metre, scientists agreed on reference standards that make it possible to calibrate all measuring devices. For getting reliable measurements, all devices such as</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">metre sticks</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">and</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">analytical balances</span> <span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">have been calibrated by their manufacturers to give correct readings. However, each of these devices is standardised or calibrated against some reference. The mass standard is the kilogram since 1889. It has been defined as the mass of platinum-iridium (Pt-Ir) cylinder that is stored in an airtight jar at International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Sevres, France. Pt-Ir was chosen for this standard because it is highly resistant to chemical attack and its mass will not change for an extremely long time.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">Scientists are in search of a new standard for mass. This is being attempted through accurate determination of Avogadro constant. Work on this new standard focuses on ways to measure accurately the number of atoms in a well-defined mass of sample.

      <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1" lang="en-US">The metre was originally defined as the length between two marks on a Pt-Ir bar kept at a temperature of 0°C (273.15 K).

Although this was a cumbersome number, it preserved the length of the metre at its agreed value. The metre was redefined in 1983 by CGPM as the length of path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second. Similar to the length and the mass, there are reference standards for other physical quantities.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><br class="calibre5" />
    Many a times in the study of chemistry, one has to deal with experimental data as well as theoretical calculations. There are meaningful ways to handle the numbers conveniently and present the data realistically with certainty to the extent possible. These ideas are discussed below in detail.</p>

    <p class="subheading"><span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-US"><br class="calibre5" /></span></p>

    <p class="subheading"><span class="char-style-override4" lang="en-US">1.4.1 Scientific Notation</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1"><br class="calibre5" />
    As chemistry is the</span> <span class="char-style-override1">study of atoms and molecules which have extremely low masses and are present in extremely large numbers, a chemist has to deal with numbers as large as 602, 200,000,000,000,000,000,000 for the molecules of 2 g of hydrogen gas or as small as 0.00000000000000000000000166 g mass of a H atom. Similarly other constants such as Planck’s constant, speed of light, charges on particles etc., involve numbers of the above magnitude.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1">It may loo</span>k funny for a moment to write or count numbers involving so many zeros but it offers a real challenge to do simple mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication or division with such numbers. You can write any two numbers of the above type and try any one of the operations you like to accept the challenge and then you will really appreciate the difficulty in handling such numbers.</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">This problem is solved by using scientific notation for such numbers, <span class="calibre13">i.e.,</span> exponential notation in which any number can be represented in the form N × 10<span class="char-style-override6">n</span> where n is an exponent having positive or negative values and N is a number (called digit term) which varies between 1.000... and 9.999....</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">Thus, we can write 232.508 as 2.32508 <span class="char-style-override1">×</span>10<span class="char-style-override6">2</span> in scientific notation. Note that while writing it, the decimal had to be moved to the <span class="calibre13">left</span> by two places and same is the exponent (2) of 10 in the scientific notation.</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">Similarly, 0.00016 can be written as 1.6 <span class="char-style-override1">×</span> 10<span class="char-style-override6">&ndash;4</span>. Here the decimal has to be moved four places to the <span class="calibre13">right</span> and ( &ndash; 4) is the exponent in the scientific notation.</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">Now, for performing mathematical operations on numbers expressed in scientific notations, the following points are to be kept in mind.</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override5"><br class="calibre5" /></span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override5">Multiplication and Division</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">These two operations follow the same rules which are there for exponential numbers, i.e.</p>

    <div class="calibre5"><img alt="1532.png" class="frame" src="images/000026.png" /></div>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override5"><br class="calibre5" /></span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override5">Addition and Subtraction</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">For these two operations, first the numbers are written in such a <span class="char-style-override1">way that they have same exponent. After that, the coefficient are added or subtracted as the case may be.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1">Thus, for adding 6.65 × 10</span><span class="char-style-override6">4</span> <span class="char-style-override1">and 8.95 × 10</span><span class="char-style-override6">3</span><span class="char-style-override1">,</span> 6.65 × 10<span class="char-style-override6">4</span> + 0.895 × 10<span class="char-style-override6">4</span> exponent is made same for both the numbers.</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1">Then, these numbers can be added as follows (6.65 + 0.895) × 10</span><span class="char-style-override6">4</span> <span class="char-style-override1">= 7.545 × 10</span><span class="char-style-override6">4</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">Similarly, the subtraction of two numbers can be done as shown below :</p>

    <p class="calibre4"><span class="char-style-override1">2.5 × 10</span><span class="char-style-override6">&ndash;2</span> <span class="char-style-override1">&ndash; 4.8 × 10</span><span class="char-style-override6">&ndash;3</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4"><span class="char-style-override1">= (2.5 × 10</span><span class="char-style-override6">&ndash;2</span><span class="char-style-override1">) &ndash; (0.48 × 10</span><span class="char-style-override6">&ndash;2</span><span class="char-style-override1">)</span></p>

    <p class="calibre4"><span class="char-style-override1">= (2.5 &ndash; 0.48) × 10</span><span class="char-style-override6">&ndash;2</span> <span class="char-style-override1">= 2.02 × 10</span><span class="char-style-override6">&ndash;2</span></p>

    Every experimental m</span>easurement has some amount of uncertainty associated with it. However, one would always like the results to be precise and accurate. Precision and accuracy are often referred to while we talk about the measurement.</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="calibre12">Precision</span> refers to the closeness of various measurements for the same quantity. However, <span class="calibre12">accuracy</span> is the agreement of a particular value to the true value of the result. For example, if the true value for a result is 2.00 g and a student ‘A’ takes two measurements and reports the results as 1.95 g and 1.93 g. These values are precise as they are close to each other but are not accurate. Another student repeats the experiment and obtains 1.94 g and 2.05 g as the results for two measurements. These observations are neither precise nor accurate. When a third student repeats these measurements and reports 2.01g and 1.9<span class="char-style-override1">9</span>g as the result. These values are both precise and accurate. This can be more clearly understood from the data given in Table 1.4</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><br class="calibre5" /></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">The uncertainty in the experimental or the calculated values is indicated by mentioning the number of significant figures. <span class="calibre12">Significant figures</span> are meaningful digits which are known with certainty. The uncertainty is indicated by writing the certain digits and the last uncertain digit. Thus, if we write a result as 11.2 mL, we say the 11 is certain and 2 is uncertain and the uncertainty would be <span class="char-style-override1">±</span>1 in the last digit. Unless otherwise stated, an uncertainty of ±<span class="char-style-override1">1 in the last digit is always understood.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">There are certain rules for determining the number of significant figures. These are stated below:</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">(1) All non-zero digits are significant. For example in 285 cm, there are three significant figures and in 0.25 mL, there are two significant figures.</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">(2) Zeros preceding to first non-zero digit are not significant. Such zero indicates the position of decimal point.</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1">Thus, 0.03 has one significant figure and 0.0052 has two significant figures.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1">(3) Zeros betwe</span><span class="char-style-override1">e</span><span class="char-style-override1">n two non-zero digits are significant. Th</span><span class="char-style-override1">us, 2.005 has four significant figures.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">(4) Zeros at the end or right of a number are significant provided they are on the right side of the decimal point. For example, 0.200 g has three significant figures.</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1">But, if otherwise, the terminal zeros are not significant if there is no decimal point. For example, 100 has only one significant figure, but 100. has three significant figures and 100.0 has four significant figures. Such numbers are better represented in scientific notation. We can express the number 100 as 1×10</span><span class="char-style-override6">2</span> <span class="char-style-override1">for one significant figure, 1.0×10</span><span class="char-style-override6">2</span> <span class="char-style-override1">for two significant figures and 1.00×10</span><span class="char-style-override6">2</span> <span class="char-style-override1">for three significant figures.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">(5) Counting numbers of objects, for example, 2 balls or 20 eggs, have infinite significant figures as these are exact numbers and can be represented by writing infinite number of zeros after placing a decimal i.e., 2 = 2.000000 or 20 = 20.000000</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1">In numbers written in scientific notation, all digits are significant e.g., 4.01×10</span><span class="char-style-override6">2</span> <span class="char-style-override1">has three significant figures, and 8.256 × 10</span><span class="char-style-override6">&ndash;3</span> <span class="char-style-override1">has four significant figures.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override5">Addition and Subtraction of Significant Figures</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">The result cannot have more digits to the right of the decimal point than either of the original numbers.</p>

    <p class="calibre4"><img alt="add" src="images/000041.png" class="frame" /><br class="calibre5" /></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">Here, 18.0 has only one digit after the decimal point and the result should be reported only up to one digit after the decimal point which<br class="calibre5" />
    is 31.1.</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override5"><br class="calibre5" /></span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override5">Multiplication and Division of Significant Figures</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">In these operations, the result must be reported with no more significant figures as are there in the measurement with the few significant figures.</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">1. If the rightmost digit to be removed is more than 5, the preceding number is increased by one. for example, 1.386</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">If we have to remove 6, we have to round it to 1.39</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1">2.

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">3. If the rightmost digit to be removed is 5, then the preceding number is not changed if it is an even number but it is increased by one if it is an odd number.

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1"><br class="calibre5" />
    Often while calculating, there is a need to convert units from one system to other. The method used to accomplish this is called</span> <span class="calibre12">factor label method</span> <span class="char-style-override1">or</span> <span class="calibre12">unit factor method</span> <span class="char-style-override1">or</span> <span class="calibre12">dimensional analysis</span><span class="char-style-override1">. This is illustrated belo</span><span class="char-style-override1">w.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="calibre12">Example</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">A piece of metal is 3 inch (represented by in) long. What is its length in cm?</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">We know that 1 in = 2.54 cm</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1">From this equiva</span>lence, we can write</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1"><span class="char-style-override1"><img alt="2010.png" class="frame" src="images/000012.png" /></span></span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">thus <span class="char-style-override1"><span class="char-style-override1"><img alt="2015.png" class="img1" src="images/000020.png" /></span></span> equals 1 and <span class="char-style-override1"><span class="char-style-override1"><img alt="2020.png" class="img1" src="images/000029.png" /></span></span> also equals 1. Both of these are called <span class="calibre12">unit factors</span>. If some number is multiplied by these unit factors (i.e. 1), it will not be affected otherwise.</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">Say, the 3 in given above is multiplied by the unit factor. So,</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">3 in = 3 in × <span class="char-style-override1"><img alt="2025.png" class="frame" src="images/000039.png" /></span> = 3 × 2.54 cm = 7.62 cm</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">Now the unit factor by which multiplication is to be done is that unit factor (<span class="char-style-override1"><img alt="2030.png" class="frame" src="images/000046.png" /></span> in the above case) which gives the desired units i.e., the numerator should have that part which is required in the desired result.</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">It should also be noted in the above example that units can be handled just like other numerical part. It can be cancelled, divided, multiplied, squared etc. Let us study one more example for it.</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="calibre12">Example</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">A jug contains <span class="char-style-override1">2</span>L of milk. Calculate the volume of the milk in m<span class="char-style-override6">3</span>.</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">Since 1 L = 1000 cm<span class="char-style-override6">3</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">and 1m = 100 cm which gives <span class="char-style-override1"><img alt="2035.png" class="frame" src="images/000054.png" /></span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">To get m<span class="char-style-override6">3</span> from the above unit factors, the first unit factor is taken and it is cubed.</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1"><img alt="2040.png" class="frame" src="images/000063.png" /></span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">Now 2 L = 2×1000 cm<span class="char-style-override6">3</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style">The above is multiplied by the unit factor</p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1"><img alt="2045.png" class="frame" src="images/000072.png" /></span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="calibre12">Example</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1"><br class="calibre5" />
    The atomic mass or the mass of an atom is actually very-very small because atoms are extremely small. Today, we have sophisticated techniques e.g., mass spectrometry for determining the atomic masses fairly accurately. But, in the nineteenth century, scientists could determine mass of one atom</span> <span class="calibre12">relative</span> <span class="char-style-override1">to another by experimental means, as has been mentioned earlier. Hydrogen, being lightest atom was arbitrarily assigned a mass of 1 (without any units) and other elements were assigned masses relative to it. However, the present system of atomic masses is based on carbon - 12 as the standard and has been agreed upon in 1961. Here, Carbon - 12 is one of the</span> <span class="char-style-override1">isotopes</span> <span class="char-style-override1">of carbon and can be represented as</span> <span class="char-style-override6">12</span><span class="char-style-override1">C. In this system,</span> <span class="char-style-override6">12</span><span class="char-style-override1">C is assigned a mass of exactly 12 atomic mass unit (</span><span class="calibre12">amu</span><span class="char-style-override1">) and masses of all other atoms are given relative to this standard. One</span> <span class="calibre12">atomic mass unit</span> <span class="char-style-override1">is defined as a mass exactly equal to one-twelfth the mass of one carbon - 12 atom.</span></p>

    <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1">And 1 amu = 1.66056×10</span><span class="char-style-override6">&ndash;24</span> <span class="char-style-override1">g</span></p>

    So far, we were dealing with the number of entities present in a given sample. But many a time, the information regarding the percentage of a particular element present in a compound is required.

For known compounds also, such information provides a check whether the given sample contains the same percentage of elements as is present in a pure sample. In other words, one can check the purity of a given sample by analysing this data.</span></p>

      <p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre12">SUMMARY</b></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style">The study of chemistry i<span class="char-style-override1">s very important as its domain encompasses every sphere of life. Chemists study the properties and structure of substances and the changes undergone by them. All substances contain matter which can exist in three states &ndash; solid, liquid or gas. The constituent particles are held in different ways in these states of matter and they exhibit their characteristic properties. Matter can also be classified into elements, compounds or mixtures. An</span> <span class="calibre12">element</span> <span class="char-style-override1">contains particles of only one type which may be</span> <span class="calibre12">atoms</span> <span class="char-style-override1">or</span> <span class="calibre12">molecules</span><span class="char-style-override1">. The compounds are formed where atoms of two or more elements combine in a fixed ratio to each other. Mixtures occur widely and many of the substances present around us are mixtures.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style">When the properties of a substance are studied, measurement is inherent. The quantification of properties requires a system of measurement and units in which the quantities are to be expressed. Many systems of measurement exist out of which the English and the Metric Systems are widely used. The scientific community, however, has agreed to have a uniform and common system throughout the world which is abbreviated as SI units (International System of Units).</p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1">Since measurements involve recording of data which are always associated with a certain amount of uncertainty, the proper handling of data obtained by measuring the quantities is very important. The measurements of quantities in chemistry are spread over a wide range of 10</span><span class="char-style-override6">&ndash;31</span> <span class="char-style-override1">to 10</span><span class="char-style-override6">+23</span><span class="char-style-override1">. Hence, a convenient system of expressing the numbers in</span> <span class="calibre12">scientific notation</span> <span class="char-style-override1">is used. The uncertainty is taken care of by specifying the number of</span> <span class="calibre12">significant figures</span> <span class="char-style-override1">in which the observations are reported. The</span> <span class="calibre12">dimensional analysis</span> <span class="char-style-override1">helps to express the measured quantities in different systems of units. Hence, it is possible to interconvert the results from one system of units to another.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1">The combination of different atoms is governed by basic laws of chemical combination &ndash; these being the</span> <span class="calibre12">Law of Conservation of Mass,</span> <span class="calibre12">Law of Definite Proportions, Law of Multiple Proportions, Gay Lussac’s Law of Gaseous Volumes</span> <span class="char-style-override1">and</span> <span class="calibre12">Avogadro Law</span><span class="char-style-override1">. All these laws led to the</span> <span class="calibre12">Dalton’s atomic theory</span> <span class="char-style-override1">which states that atoms are building blocks of matter. The</span> <span class="calibre12">atomic mass</span> <span class="char-style-override1">of an element is expressed relative to</span> <span class="char-style-override6">12</span><span class="char-style-override1">C isotope of</span> <span class="char-style-override1">carbon which has an exact value of 12u. Usually, the atomic mass used for an element</span> <span class="char-style-override1">is the</span> <span class="calibre12">average atomic mass</span> <span class="char-style-override1">obtained by taking into account the natural abundance of different isotopes of that element. The</span> <span class="calibre12">molecular mass</span> <span class="char-style-override1">of a molecule is obtained by taking sum of the atomic masses of different atoms present in a molecule. The</span> <span class="calibre12">molecular formula</span> <span class="char-style-override1">can be calculated by determining the mass per cent of different elements present in a compound and its molecular mass.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1">The number of atoms, molecules or any other particles present in a given system are expressed in the terms of</span> <span class="calibre12">Avogadro constant</span> <span class="char-style-override1">(6.022 × 10</span><span class="char-style-override6">23</span><span class="char-style-override1">). This is known as</span> <span class="calibre12">1 mol</span> <span class="char-style-override1">of the respective particles or entities.</span></p>

      <p class="no-paragraph-style"><span class="char-style-override1">Chemical reactions represent the chemical changes undergone by different elements and compounds. A</span> <span class="calibre12">balanced</span> <span class="char-style-override1">chemical equation provides a lot of information. The coefficients indicate the molar ratios and the respective number of particles taking part in a particular reaction. The quantitative study of the reactants required or the products formed is called</span> <span class="calibre12">stoichiometry</span><span class="char-style-override1">. Using stoichiometric calculations, the amounts of one or more reactant(s) required to produce a particular amount of product can be determined and vice-versa. The amount of substance present in a given volume of a solution is expressed in number of ways, e.g., mass per cent, mole fraction, molarity and molality.</span></p>
