    <p class="conceptheading"><span class="char-style-override">Introduction</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1"><br class="basic-graphics-frame" />
    In previous units we h</span><span class="char-style-override1">ave learnt about the properties related to single particle of matter, such as atomic size, ionization enthalpy, electronic charge density, molecular shape and polarity, etc. Most of the observable characteristics of chemical systems with which we are familiar represent bulk properties of matter,</span> <span class="char-style-override1">i.e.,</span> <span class="char-style-override1">the properties associated with a collection of a large number of atoms, ions or molecules. For example, an individual molecule of a liquid does not boil but the bulk boils. Collection of water molecules have wetting properties; individual molecules do not wet. Water can exist as ice, which is a solid; it can exist as liquid; or it can exist in the gaseous state as water vapour or steam. Physical properties of ice, water and steam are very different. In all the three states of water chemical composition of water remains the same i.e., H</span><sub class="calibre11">2</sub><span class="char-style-override1">O. Characteristics of the three states of water depend on the energies of molecules and on the manner in which water molecules aggregate. Same is true for other substances also.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">Chemical properties of a substance do not change with the change of its physical state; but rate of chemical reactions do depend upon the physical state. Many times in calculations while dealing with data of experiments we require knowledge of the state of matter. Therefore, it becomes necessary fo</span><span class="char-style-override1">r a chemist to know the physical laws which govern the behaviour of matter in different states. In this unit, we will learn more about these three physical states of matter particularly liquid and gaseous states. To begin with, it is necessary to understand the nature of intermolecular forces, molecular interactions and effect of thermal energy on the motion of particles because a balance between these determines the state of a substance.</span></p>

    <p class="conceptheading"><span class="char-style-override"><br class="calibre3" /></span></p>

    <p class="conceptheading"><span class="char-style-override">5.1 Intermolecular Forces</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="calibre9"><br class="basic-graphics-frame" />
    Intermolecular forces</span> <span class="char-style-override1">are the forces of attraction and repulsion between interacting particles (atoms and molecules). This term does not include the electrostatic forces that exist between the two oppositely charged ions and the forces that hold atoms of a molecule together i.e., covalent bonds.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">Attractive intermolecular forces are known as</span> <span class="calibre9">van der Waals forces</span><span class="char-style-override1">, in honour of Dutch scientist Johannes van der Waals (1837-1923), who explained the deviation of real gases from the ideal behaviour through these forces. We will learn about this later in this unit. van der Waals forces vary considerably in magnitude and include dispersion forces or London forces, dipole-dipole forces, and dipole-induced dipole forces. A particularly strong type of dipole-dipole interaction is hydrogen bonding.</span> <span class="calibre9">Only a few elements can participate in hydrogen bond formation, therefore it is treated as a separate category.</span> <span class="char-style-override1">We have already learnt about this interaction in Unit 4.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">At this point, it is important to note that attractive forces between an ion and a dipole are known as ion-dipole forces and these are not van der Waals forces. We will now learn about different types of van der Waals forces.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override2"><br class="basic-graphics-frame" /></span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override2">5.1.1 Dispersion Forces or London Forces</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1"><br class="basic-graphics-frame" /></span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">Atoms and nonpolar molecules are electrically symmetrical and have no dipole moment because their electronic charge cloud is symmetrically distributed. But a dipole may develop momentarily even in such atoms and molecules. This can be understood as follows. Suppose we have two atoms ‘A’ and ‘B’ in the close vicinity of each other (Fig. 5.1a). It may so happen that momentarily electronic charge distribution in one of the atoms, say ‘A’, becomes unsymmetrical</span> <span class="char-style-override1">i.e.,</span> <span class="char-style-override1">the charge cloud is more on one side than the other (Fig. 5.1 b and c). This results in the development of instantaneous dipole on the atom ‘A’ for a very short time. This instantaneous or transient dipole distorts the electron density of the other atom ‘B’, which is close to it and as a consequence a dipole is induced in the atom ‘B’.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">The temporary dipoles of atom ‘A’ and ‘B’ attract each other. Similarly temporary dipoles are induced in molecules also. This force of attraction was first proposed by the German physicist Fritz London,</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">and for this reason force of attraction between two temporary dipoles is known as</span> <span class="calibre9">London force</span><span class="char-style-override1">. Another name for this force is</span> <span class="calibre9">dispersion force</span><span class="char-style-override1">. These forces are always attractive and interaction energy is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the distance between two interacting particles (i.e., 1/</span><span class="char-style-override1">r</span><sup class="calibre12">6</sup> <span class="char-style-override1">where</span> <span class="char-style-override1">r</span> <span class="char-style-override1">is the distance between two particles). These forces are important only at short distances (~500 pm) and their magnitude depends on the polarisability of the particle.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1"><br class="basic-graphics-frame" /></span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">Dipole-dipole forces act between the molecules possessing permanent dipole. Ends of the dipoles possess “partial charges” and these charges are shown by Greek letter</span> <span class="char-style-override1">delta</span> <span class="char-style-override1">(</span><span class="char-style-override1">δ</span><span class="char-style-override1">). Partial charges are always less than the unit electronic charge (1.6×10</span><sup class="calibre12">&ndash;19</sup> <span class="char-style-override1">C). The polar molecules interact with neighbouring molecules. Fig 5.2 (a) shows electron cloud distribution in the dipole of hydrogen chloride and Fig. 5.2 (b) shows dipole-dipole interaction between two HCl molecules. This interaction is stronger than the London forces but is weaker than ion-ion interaction because only partial charges are involved. The attractive force decreases with the increase of distance between the dipoles. As in the above case here also, the interaction energy is inversely proportional to distance between polar molecules. Dipole-dipole interaction energy between stationary polar molecules (as in solids) is proportional to 1/</span><span class="char-style-override1">r</span><sup class="calibre12">3</sup> <span class="char-style-override1">and that between rotating polar molecules is proportional</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">This type of attractive forces operate between the polar molecules having permanent dipole and the molecules lacking permanent dipole. Permanent dipole of the polar molecule induces dipole on the electrically neutral molecule by deforming its electronic cloud (Fig. 5.3). Thus an induced dipole is developed in the other molecule.

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1"><br class="basic-graphics-frame" />
    As already mentioned in section (5.1); this is special case of dipole-dipole interaction. We have already learnt about this in Unit 4. This is found in the molecules in which highly polar N&ndash;H, O&ndash;H or H&ndash;F bonds are present. Although hydrogen bonding is regarded as being limited to N, O and F; but species such as</span> <span class="char-style-override1"><span class="char-style-override1"><img alt="1638.png" class="frame1" src="images/000006.png" /></span></span> <span class="char-style-override1">may also participate in hydrogen bonding. Energy of hydrogen bond varies between 10 to 100 kJ mol</span><sup class="calibre12">&ndash;1</sup><span class="char-style-override1">. This is quite a significant amount of energy; therefore, hydrogen bonds are powerful force in determining the structure and properties of many compounds, for example proteins and nucleic acids. Strength of the hydrogen bond is determined by the coulombic interaction between the lone-pair electrons of the electronegative atom of one molecule and the hydrogen atom of other molecule. Following diagram shows the formation of hydrogen bond.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">Intermolecular forces discussed so far are all attractive.</span> <span class="calibre9">Molecules also exert repulsive forces</span> <span class="char-style-override1">on one another. When two molecules are brought into close contact with each other, the repulsion between the electron clouds and that between the nuclei of two molecules comes into play. Magnitude of the repulsion rises very rapidly as the distance separating the molecules decreases. This is the reason that liquids and solids are hard to compress. In these states molecules are already in close contact; therefore they resist further compression; as that would result in the increase of repulsive interactions.</span></p>

    <p class="conceptheading"><span class="char-style-override">5.2 Thermal Energy</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1"><br class="basic-graphics-frame" />
    Thermal energy is the energy of a body arising from motion of its atoms or molecules. It is directly proportional to the temperature of the substance. It is the measure of average kinetic energy of the particles of the matter and is thus responsible for movement of particles. This movement of particles is called thermal motion.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1"><br class="basic-graphics-frame" />
    We have already learnt that intermolecular forces tend to keep the molecules together but thermal energy of the molecules tends to keep them</span> <span class="char-style-override1">apart. Three states of matter are the result of balance between intermolecular forces and the thermal energy of the molecules.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">When molecular interactions are very weak, molecules do not cling together to make liquid or solid unless thermal energy is reduced by lowering the temperature. Gases do not liquify on compression only, although molecules come very close to each other and</span> <span class="char-style-override1">intermolecular forces operate to the maximum.</span> <span class="char-style-override1">However, when thermal energy of molecules is reduced by lowering the temperature; the gases can be very easily liquified. Predominance of thermal energy and the molecular interaction energy of a substance in three states is depicted as follows :</span></p>

    <p class="heading1">We have already learnt the cause for the existence of the three states of matter. Now we will learn more about gaseous and liquid states and the laws which govern the behaviour of matter in these states. We shall deal with the solid state in class XII.</p>

    <p class="conceptheading"><span class="char-style-override">5.4 The Gaseous State</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1"><br class="basic-graphics-frame" />
    This is the simplest state of matter. Throughout our life we remain immersed in the ocean of air which is a mixture of gases. We spend our life in the lowermost layer of the atmosphere called troposphere, which is held to the surface of the earth by gravitational force. The thin layer of atmosphere is vital to our life. It shields us from harmful radiations and contains substances like dioxygen, dinitrogen, carbon dioxide, water vapour, etc.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">Let us now focus our attention on the behaviour of substances which exist in the gaseous state under normal conditions of temperature and pressure. A look at the periodic table sho</span><span class="char-style-override1">ws that only eleven elements exist as gases under normal conditions (Fig 5.4).</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">Simplicity of gases is due to the fact that the forces of interaction between their molecules are negligible. Their behaviour is governed by same general laws, which were discovered as a result of their experimental studies. These laws are relationships between measurable properties of gases. Some of these properties like pressure, volume, temperature and mass are very important because relationships between these variables describe state of the gas. Interdependence of these variables leads to the formulation of gas laws. In the next section we will learn about gas laws.</span></p>

    The gas laws which we will study now are the result of research carried on for several centuries o</span><span class="char-style-override1">n the physical properties of gases. The first reliable measurement on properties of gases was made by Anglo-Irish scientist Robert Boyle in 1662. The law which he formulated is known as Boyle’s Law.

    Charles and Gay Lussac performed several experiments on gases independently to improve upon hot air balloon technology. Their investigations showed that for a fixed mass of a gas at constant pressure, volume of a gas increases on increasing temperature and decreases on cooling. They found that for each degree rise in temperature, volume of a gas increases by <span class="char-style-override1"><img alt="1688.png" class="frame1" src="images/000001.png" /></span> of the original volume of the gas at 0</span> <sup class="calibre12">°</sup><span class="char-style-override1">C.

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1"><br class="basic-graphics-frame" />
    So far we have learnt the laws (e.g., Boyle’s law, Charles’ law etc.) which are concise statements of experimental facts observed in the laboratory by the scientists. Conducting careful experiments is an important aspect of scientific method and it tells us how the particular system is beh</span><span class="char-style-override1">aving under different conditions. However, once the experimental facts are established, a scientist is curious to know why the system is behaving in that way. For example, gas laws help us to predict that pressure increases when we compress gases but we would like to know what happens at molecular level when a gas is compressed ? A theory is constructed to answer such questions. A theory is a model (i.e., a mental picture) that enables us to better understand our observations. The theory that attempts to elucidate the behaviour of gases is known as kinetic molecular theory.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">Assumptions or postulates of the kinetic-molecular theory of gases are given below. These postulates are related to atoms and molecules which cannot be seen, hence it is said to provide a microscopic model of gases.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"></p>

    <ul class="calibre7">
      <li class="calibre8">Gases consist of large number of identical particles (atoms or molecules) that are so small and so far apart on the average that the actual volume of the molecules is negligible in comparison to the empty space between them. They are considered as point masses. This assumption explains the great compressibility of gases.<br class="basic-graphics-frame" /></li>

      <li class="calibre8">There is no force of attraction between the particles of a gas at ordinary temperature and pressure. The support for this assumption comes from the fact that gases expand and occupy all the space available to them.<br class="basic-graphics-frame" /></li>

      <li class="calibre8">Particles of a gas are always in constant and random motion. If the particles were at rest and occupied fixed positions, then a gas would have had a fixed shape which is not observed.<br class="basic-graphics-frame" /></li>

      <li class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override1">Particles of a gas move in all possible directions in straight lines. During their random motion, they collide with each other and with the walls of the container. Pressure is exerted by the ga</span><span class="char-style-override1">s as a result of collision of the particles</span> <span class="char-style-override1">with the walls of the container.</span><br class="basic-graphics-frame" /></li>

      <li class="calibre8"><span class="char-style-override1">Collisions of gas molecules are perfectly elastic. This means that total energy of molecules before and after the collision remains same. There may be exchange of energy between colliding molecules, their individual energies may change, but the sum of their energies remains constant. If there were loss of kinetic energy, the motion</span> <span class="char-style-override1">of molecules will stop and gases will settle down. This is contrary to what is actually observed.</span><br class="basic-graphics-frame" /></li>

      <li class="calibre8">At any particular time, different particles in the gas have different speeds and hence different kinetic energies. This assumption is reasonable because as the particles collide, we expect their speed to change. Even if initial speed of all the particles was same, the molecular collisions will disrupt this uniformity. Consequently the particles must have different speeds, which go on changing constantly. It is possible to show that though the individual speeds are changing, the distribution of speeds remains constant at a particular temperature.<br class="basic-graphics-frame" /></li>

      <li class="calibre8">If a molecule has variable speed, then it must have a variable kinetic energy. Under these circumstances, we can talk only about average kinetic energy. In kinetic theory it is assumed that average kinetic energy of the gas molecules is directly proportional to the absolute temperature. It is seen that on heating a gas at constant volume, the pressure increases. On heating the gas, kinetic energy of the particles increases and these strike the walls of the container more frequently thus exerting more pressure.<br class="basic-graphics-frame" /></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">Kinetic theory of gases allows us to derive theoretically, all the gas laws studied in the previous sections. Calculations and predictions based on kinetic theory of gases agree very well with the experimental observations and thus establish the correctness of this model.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">It can be seen easily that at constant temperature</span> <span class="char-style-override1">pV</span> <span class="char-style-override1">vs</span> <span class="char-style-override1">p</span> <span class="char-style-override1">plot for real gases is not a straight line. There is a significant deviation from ideal behaviour. Two types of curves are seen.In the curves for dihydrogen and helium, as the pressure increases the value of</span> <span class="char-style-override1">pV</span> <span class="char-style-override1">also increases. The second type of plot is seen in the case of other gases like carbon monoxide and methane. In these plots first there is a negative deviation from ideal behaviour, the</span> <span class="char-style-override1">pV</span> <span class="char-style-override1">value decreases with increase in pressure and reaches to a minimum value characteristic of a gas. After that</span> <span class="char-style-override1">pV</span> <span class="char-style-override1">value starts increasing. The curve then crosses the line for ideal gas and after that shows positive deviation continuously. It is thus, found that real gases do not follow ideal gas equation perfectly under all conditions.</span><br class="basic-graphics-frame" /></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">Deviation from ideal behaviour also becomes apparent when pressure</span> <span class="char-style-override1">vs</span> <span class="char-style-override1">volume plot is drawn.

Fig 5.9 shows these plots. It is apparent that at very high pressure the measured volume is more than the calculated volume. At low pressures, measured and calculated volumes approach each other.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">It is found that real gases do not follow, Boyle’s law, Charles law and Avogadro law perfectly under all conditions. Now two questions arise.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">(i) Why do gases deviate from the ideal behaviour?</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">(ii) What are the conditions under which gases deviate from ideality?</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">We get the answer of the first question if we look into postulates of kinetic theory once again. We find that two assumptions of the kinetic theory do not hold good. These are</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">(a) There is no force of attraction between the molecules of a gas.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">(b) Volume of the molecules of a gas is negligibly small in comparison to the space occupied by the gas.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">If assumption (a) is correct, the gas will never liquify. However, we know that gases do liquify when cooled and compressed. Also, liquids formed are very difficult to compress. This means that forces of repulsion are powerful enough and prevent squashing of molecules in tiny volume. If assumption (b) is correct, the pressure</span> <span class="char-style-override1">vs</span> <span class="char-style-override1">volume graph of experimental data (real gas) and that theoritically calculated from Boyles law (ideal gas) should coincide.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">Real gases show deviations from ideal gas law because molecules interact with each other. At high pressures molecules of gases are very close to each other. Molecular interactions start operating. At high pressure, molecules do not strike the walls of the container with full impact because these are dragged back by other molecules due to molecular attractive forces. This affects the pressure exerted by the molecules on the walls of the container. Thus, the pressure exerted by the gas is lower than the pressure exerted by the ideal gas.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1"><img alt="530" src="images/000093.png" class="frame1" /> (5.30)</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1"><br class="basic-graphics-frame" /></span></p>

    <p class="heading1">Here, a is a constant.<br class="basic-graphics-frame" /></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">Repulsive forces also become significant. Repulsive interactions are short-range interactions and are significant when molecules are almost in contact. This is the situation at high pressure. The repulsive forces cause the molecules to behave as small but impenetrable spheres. The volume occupied by the molecules also becomes significant because instead of moving in volume</span> <span class="char-style-override1">V</span><span class="char-style-override1">, these are now restricted to volume (</span><span class="char-style-override1">V</span><span class="char-style-override1">&ndash;</span><span class="char-style-override1">n</span><span class="char-style-override1">b) where</span> <span class="char-style-override1">n</span><span class="char-style-override1">b is approximately the total volume occupied by the molecules themselves. Here, b is a constant. Having taken into account the corrections for pressure and volume, we can rewrite equation (5.17) as</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1"><span class="char-style-override1"><br class="basic-graphics-frame" /></span></span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1"><br class="basic-graphics-frame" /></span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">Equation (5.31) is known as van der Waals equation. In this equation</span> <span class="char-style-override1">n</span> <span class="char-style-override1">is number of moles of the gas. Constants a and b are called van der Waals constants and their value depends on the characteristic of a gas. Value of ‘a’ is measure of magnitude of intermolecular attractive forces within the gas and is independent of temperature and pressure.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">Also, at very low temperature, intermolecular forces become significant. As the molecules travel with low average speed, these can be captured by one another due to attractive forces. Real gases show ideal behaviour when conditions of temperature and pressure are such that the intermolecular forces are practically negligible. The real gases show ideal behaviour when pressure approaches zero.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">The deviation from ideal behaviour can be measured in terms of</span> <span class="calibre9">compressibility factor</span> <span class="char-style-override1">Z</span><span class="char-style-override1">, which is the ratio of product</span> <span class="char-style-override1">pV</span> <span class="char-style-override1">and</span> <span class="char-style-override1">n</span><span class="char-style-override1">R</span><span class="char-style-override1">T</span><span class="char-style-override1">.

    First complet</span><span class="char-style-override1">e data on pressure - volume - temperature relations of a substance in both gaseous and liquid state was obtained by Thomas Andrews on carbon dioxide. He plotted isotherms of carbon dioxide at various temperatures (Fig. 5.11). Later on it was found that real gases behave in the same manner as carbon dioxide. Andrews noticed that at high temperatures isotherms look like that of an ideal gas and the gas cannot be liquified even at very high pressure. As the temperature is lowered, shape of the curve changes and data shows considerable deviation from ideal behaviour.</span></p>

(Poi</span><span class="char-style-override1">nt E in Fig. 5.11). At 73 atmospheric pressure, liquid carbon dioxide appears for the first time. The temperature 30.98</span> <sup class="calibre12">°</sup><span class="char-style-override1">C is called</span> <span class="calibre9">critical temperature (</span><span class="char-style-override1">T</span><sub class="calibre11">C</sub><span class="calibre9">)</span> <span class="char-style-override1">of carbon dioxide. This is the highest temperature at which liquid carbon dioxide is observed. Above this temperature it is gas. Volume of one mole of the gas at critical temperature is called</span> <span class="calibre9">critical volume (</span><span class="char-style-override1">V</span><sub class="calibre11">C</sub><span class="calibre9">)</span> <span class="char-style-override1">and pressure at this temperature is called</span> <span class="calibre9">critical pressure (</span><span class="char-style-override1">p</span><sub class="calibre11">C</sub><span class="calibre9">)</span><span class="char-style-override1">. The critical temperature, pressure and volume are called critical constants. Further increase in pressure simply compresses the liquid carbon dioxide and the curve represents the compressibility of the liquid. The steep line represents the isotherm of liquid. Even a slight compression results in steep rise in pressure indicating very low compressibility of the liquid. Below 30.98</span> <sup class="calibre12">°</sup><span class="char-style-override1">C, the behaviour of the gas on compression is quite different. At 21.5</span> <sup class="calibre12">°</sup><span class="char-style-override1">C, carbon dioxide remains as a gas only upto point B.

Below 30.98</span> <sup class="calibre12">°</sup><span class="char-style-override1">C (critical temperature) each curve shows the similar trend. Only length of the horizontal line increases at lower temperatures. At critical point horizontal portion of the isotherm merges into one point. Thus we see that a point like A in the Fig. 5.11 represents gaseous state. A point like D represents liquid state and a point under the dome shaped area represents existence of liquid and gaseous carbon dioxide in equilibrium. All the gases upon compression at constant temperature (isothermal compression) show the same behaviour as shown by carbon dioxide. Also above discussion shows that gases should be cooled bel</span><span class="char-style-override1">ow their critical temperature for liquification. Critical temperature of a gas is highest temperature at which liquifaction of the gas first occurs. Liquifaction of so called permanent gases (i.e., gases which show continuous positive deviation in Z value) requires cooling as well as considerable compression. Compression brings the molecules in close vicinity and cooling slows down the movement of molecules therefore, intermolecular interactions may hold the closely and slowly moving molecules together and the gas liquifies.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">It is possible to change a gas into liquid or a liquid into gas by a process in which always a single phase is present. For example in Fig. 5.11 we can move from point A to F vertically by increasing the temperature, then we can reach the point G by compressing the gas at the constant temperature along this isotherm (isotherm at 31.1°C). The pressure will increase. Now we can move vertically down towards D by lowering the temperature. As soon as we cross the point H on the critical isotherm we get liquid. We end up with liquid but in this series of changes we do not pass through two-phase region. If process is carried out at the critical temperature, substance always remains in one phase.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">Thus there is continuity between the gaseous and liquid state. The term fluid is used for either a liquid or a gas to recognise this continuity. Thus a liquid can be viewed as a very dense gas. Liquid and gas can be distinguished only when the fluid is below its critical temperature and its pressure and volume lie under the dome, since in that situation liquid and gas are in equilibrium and a surface separating the two phases is visible. In the absence of this surface there is no fundamental way of distinguishing between two states. At critical temperature, liquid passes into gaseous state imperceptibly and continuously; the surface separating two phases disappears (Section 5.10.1). A gas below the critical temperature can be liquified by applying pressure, and is called</span> <span class="calibre9">vapour</span> <span class="char-style-override1">of the substance</span><span class="char-style-override1">.

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1"><br class="basic-graphics-frame" />
    If an evacuated container is partially filled with a liquid, a portion of liquid evaporates to fill the remaining volume of the container with vapour. Initially the liquid evaporates and pressure exerted by vapours on the walls of the container (vapour pressure) increases. After some time it becomes constant, an equilibrium is established between liquid phase and vapour phase. Vapour pressure at this stage is known as</span> <span class="calibre9">equilibrium vapour pressure or saturated vapour pressure.</span><span class="char-style-override1">. Since process of vapourisation is temperature dependent; the temperature must be mentioned while reporting the vapour pressure of a liquid.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">When a</span> <span class="char-style-override1">liquid is heated in an open vessel, the liquid vapourises from the surface. At the temperature at which vapour pressure of the liquid becomes equal to the external pressure, vapourisation can occur throughout the bulk of the liquid and vapours expand freely into the surroundings. The condition of free vapourisation throughout the liquid is called boiling. The temperature at which vapour pressure of liquid is equal to the external pressure is called boiling temperature at that pressure. Vapour pressure of some common liquids at various temperatures is given in (Fig. 5.12). At 1 atm pressure boiling temperature is called</span> <span class="calibre9">normal boiling point</span><span class="char-style-override1">. If pressure is 1 bar then the boiling point is called</span> <span class="calibre9">standard boiling point</span> <span class="char-style-override1">of the liquid. Standard boiling point of the liquid is slightly lower than the normal boiling point because 1 bar pressure is slightly less than 1 atm pressure. The normal boiling point of water is 100 °C (373 K), its standard boiling point is 99.6 °C (372.6 K).</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">At high altitudes atmospheric pressure is low.

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1"><br class="basic-graphics-frame" />
    It is well known fact that liquids assume the shape of the container. Why is it then small drops of mercury form spherical bead instead of spreading on the surface. Why do particles of soil at the bottom of river remain separated but they stick together when taken out ? Why does a liquid rise (or fall) in a thin capillary as soon as the capillary touches the surface of the liquid ? All these phenomena are caused due to the characteristic property of liquids, called</span> <span class="calibre9">surface tension</span><span class="char-style-override1">. A molecule in the bulk of liquid experiences equal intermolecular forces from all sides. The molecule, therefore does not experience any net force. But for the molecule on the surface of liquid, net attractive force is towards the interior of the liquid (Fig. 5.13), due to the molecules below it. Since there are no molecules above it.</span></p>

This will require expenditure of energy. The energy required to increase the surface area of the liquid by one unit is defined as surface energy.

Surface tension is defined as the force acting per unit length perpendicular to the line drawn on the surface of liquid.

It has dimensions of kg s</span><sup class="calibre12">&ndash;2</sup> <span class="char-style-override1">and in SI unit it is expressed as N m</span><sup class="calibre12">&ndash;1</sup><span class="char-style-override1">.</span> <span class="char-style-override1">The lowest energy state of the liquid will be when surface area is minimum. Spherical shape satisfies this condition, that is why mercury drops are spherical in shape. This is the reason that sharp glass edges are heated for making them smooth. On heating, the glass melts and the surface of the liquid tends to take the rounded shape at the edges, which makes the edges smooth. This is called fire polishing of glass.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">Liquid tends to rise (or fall) in the capillary because of surface tension. Liquids wet the things because they spread across their surfaces as thin film. Moist soil grains are pulled together because surface area of thin film of water is reduced. It is surface tension which gives stretching property to the surface of a liquid. On flat surface, droplets are slightly flattened by the effect of gravity; but in the gravity free environments drops are perfectly spherical.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">The magnitude of surface tension of a liquid depends on the attractive forces between the molecules. When the attractive forces are large, the surface tension is large. Increase in temperature increases the kinetic energy of the molecules and effectiveness of intermolecular attraction decreases, so surface tension decreases as the temperature is raised.</span></p>

    <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">Greater the viscosity, the more slowly the liquid flows. Hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces are strong enough to cause high viscosity. Glass is an extremely viscous liquid. It is so viscous that many of its properties resemble solids.

      <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">Intermolecular forces operate between the particles of matter. These forces differ from pure electrostatic forces that exist between two oppositely charged ions. Also, these do not include forces that hold atoms of a covalent molecule together through covalent bond. Competition between thermal energy and intermolecular interactions determines the state of matter. “Bulk” properties of matter such as behaviour of gases, characteristics of solids and liquids and change of state depend upon energy of constituent particles and the type of interaction between them. Chemical properties of a substance do not change with change of state, but the reactivity depends upon the physical state.</span></p>

      <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">Forces of interaction between gas molecules are negligible and are almost independent of their chemical nature. Interdependence of some observable properties namely pressure, volume, temperature and mass leads to different gas laws obtained from experimental studies on gases.</span> <span class="calibre9">Boyle’s law</span> <span class="char-style-override1">states that under isothermal condition, pressure of a fixed amount of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume.</span> <span class="calibre9">Charles’ law</span> <span class="char-style-override1">is a relationship between volume and absolute temperature under isobaric condition.

Relationship between pressure, volume, temperature and number of moles of a gas describes its state and is called equation of state of the gas.

      <p class="heading1"><span class="char-style-override1">At high pressure and low temperature intermolecular forces start operating strongly between the molecules of gases because they come close to each other. Under suitable temperature and pressure conditions gases can be liquified. Liquids may be considered as continuation of gas phase into a region of small volume and very strong molecular attractions. Some properties of liquids</span> <span class="char-style-override1">e.g.,</span> <span class="char-style-override1">surface tension and viscosity are due to strong intermolecular attractive forces.</span></p>
